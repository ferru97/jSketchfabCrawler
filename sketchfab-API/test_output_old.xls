What makes it VR-ready specifically? :D
The texture looks incredibly cartoon plastic. Good job!
Hey, good question! :D This is one model in my ongoing quest to figure out what kinda cartoony stuff looks the neatest in VR. I'm sure about absolutely nothing but here's some stuff that was taken into account here to make it work in VR:

- General level of detail is pretty low. I've found that if there's too much stuff, it starts to clash with the resolution of VR glasses and make it seem like you have poor vision, or that there's something you should pay attention to but can't since the resolution won't allow it.
- Shading and colors are kept as smooth as possible, again mostly to accommodate the resolution. The smooth shading keeps shapes understandable.
- There's no extra detail or implications of depth painted anywhere, since that can easily look fake and off in VR. There's a huge visual difference between having actual geometry and painting stuff in, the old low poly 3d modeling guideline of only add vertices if it affects the silhouette or deforms isn't necessarily as true in VR as even normal maps can have a hard time selling depth properly.
Wow awesome texturing and modelling, really like the way you stylized the fur with the topology, great work!!!
Nice :D

Fantastic color scheme and overall look and feel.

Absolutely love it
Your model is part of my Artist-Pick, you can read it here: https://forum.sketchfab.com/t/artist-picks-phil-gosch/8246
Congrats, great work! :)
Super adorable! :)
Great!
For me everything is black does anyone know how to help?
Same, cant find the model? Just blackness.
There's some sort of bug going on on sketchfab's end, they're working on it though!
damn this is cute haha. lovely work (Y)
The 'black' bug should be solved by now, please let me know if you still get it.
We recommended your work to IAMAG.CO and they featured it:

Enjoy :)
Very nice! :)
Awesome design and animation <3
Are you happening to sell this one anywhere?
Hi! This fella is part of my own game project so I can't sell it off :D If you need something similar I'm available for freelance work though!

Hi, amazing video, i understand u made a cad and then rendered it, but can you tell me how to make it such that i can see it from different views in a moving video?
Hi @nirmall its actually not a video.. these are all actual animated models themselves loading in your browser.
so all you need to do is upload your animated 3d model file(not a rendered video) and sketchfab will play it like this. 
For more info on which formats(.fbx .blend and some other native formats already work) are supported visit - https://forum.sketchfab.com/t/sketchfab-animation-wiki-add-your-knowledge/3458
Thanks Chaitanya for the response, so what i understand is if i have a cad file, sketch fab will take care of the animation and render?
@kyan0s Congrats, we just featured it on our landing page :) https://twitter.com/albn/status/740538423358988289
Awesome @alban !! Thank you again !! :D
This is just amazing work. Congratulations!

Great work!
just beautiful. you're amazing for helping out so many different communities with your AAA quality models. Hope to commission you some day.
Thanks, nice to know my work can help.
Just wanted to show how we're using this model in our game, around the 0:56 mark, these mech drones serve to rehabilitate and give helpful instructions to our protagonist before heading for her next mission.

https://youtu.be/8MiDja9JVIQ?t=56s

We hope giving you appropriate credits in our game can pay back how much your mech drone and models add to our project. Thank you!
This model is now featured prominently on the Sketchfab homepage (for non-logged in users). Congratulations Willy!!
Tell you just how good this Droid is.  It's what I first saw as an ad on another site and what made me interested in joining this site.  Absolutely a wonderful job.  Too bad there is not a link to download the video too.
how do I freaking download these
@giantman1
my bad, this model is now downloable again
Not sure why I like this little robot so much, but I do.  Just looked at the youtube video of the game coming out on the PC using your robot.  XD.  Looking good so far.
Thanks for your model, I am a novice in 3D model. I think I will learn something from exploring your model. Thanks a lot!.
Very cool! Thank you. So cute.
Lovely.
Congratulations on making the front page
@JayDesigns Thanks !!
Great job! This robot is very cool! And thank you for make it downloadable.
Hi Willy, Great work on the drone. I need a ball park cost for you to do a rendering of a Frame 7 EA GE Gas Turbine.
How???? This is Awesome!
Love the texture work you did on it, really nice, thanks for the free download too, great to study from it :)
Hi. this is definitely an awesome work and effect. If you don't mind me asking, can i get a hint on how to achieve a similar effect to be uploadable to skechtfab. I need a model to be available online for a client to see? I get the part of the textures but for  the fire effect  I got no idea on where to start. @skudgee Thanks in advance.

Hey there, great animation.. but what is a purpose of handles on the bottom to exist?
@scotopicone THanx! I didnt intend any specific role , rather a module for optional addons and an overall hull hardener,or possible storeage hook.
Wow, you've reached 5000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@eden-west Thanx man! Glad you dig the cuteness! :D
Could you please make a tutorial on how to animate/create fire effects like that?
@zeriel00 Hay thanx for asking,I dont have the time currently,but i might do one in the future. Basically what i did is i made one cylinder in a cone-ish shape and made a transparency alpha texture. Than i animated it (object animation) and copied it ,then animated the other one in an oposite direction. Then i parented the jet to the metal jets body so the movement of the body carris the jet..  :)
@iggy-design Thanks for replying, I'm working on this Bomb monster: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444292189921738752/462388331670536192/Bomb-Fire-tweak.jpg I tried making the fire like you but since it's a Fireball I have no idea how I could animate it. Could you give me some advice? I'm learning how to rig right now, Thanks a lot for the help

Bro, why this 1.1 mil views? is an owl.
Just go to the kickstarter link you'll see ;)
At first glance I thought it was some sort of robot owl.
ungaybrony - It is a robot owl... kinda.  lookup OLO on Kickstarter.  Awesome project, was going to back it but didn't have the funds in time :(
So cute!
yeah this is the cutest robot and the cutest owl I have ever seen
this is the best model I have ever since. Down to the diffuse maps and lighting . Also going  into the model it is perfectly crafted all the polygons are even and even though most people can not see that the model is built in selection you made it look like one solid object.
I like it!!!
its a nice model , but don't u think 7.7k vertices are tooooo high for a model like this ?
Ulo nga lang talaga yan pare! Ulo ng kwago !
so cute, love it so much! wanna 3d print one~~

Wow! it's great to see this walking. i never thought someone would animate it! thank you.

one suggestion. the guards on the top of the arms (look a bit like claws) should be static. Other than that. Amazing. You happy for me to share the Shiz out of this??

Fil
amazing!....

just a technical question... it loaded like a dream. what is the size/format of the textures?
@juanmilanese Thanks!
@juanmilanese Thanks! There's four 1024x1024 .jpeg textures ~500 kb each, Diffuse, Spec, Normal and Emmisive
Good!
Wow-wow-wowwww!!
omg!  is really good!

can i ask how do u bind joint and skin
Thank you all guys!
@qinyi I used a very simple skeleton and skin modifier, every moving piece of geometry was linked only with its own bone:) Here is the screen of setup: http://i.imgur.com/HSNKT9V.png?1
Hi I posted before but got no response. The mech you have modelled is mine. It's a kitbash from when I worked in the Games Workshop design studio. Very nice to see my creation moving around. Are you happy for me to post and share this on my Facebook page?

Thanks man, that's appreciated. If you're in Rotterdam you can actually view this 3D model on location with the UAR ap. It's an augmented reality app for your smartphone which shows unbuilt architecture in the city. Check out the site: http://www.nai.nl/content/5974... (in Dutch) 
nice! The structure of the building is intriguing!
Really nice, which app did you use for the shadows?
I've used 3ds Max and baked the textures with vray. But many other programs with a render-engine can do this.
Absolutely magnificent.
epic
Absolutely brilliant! 
very beautiful!!!!!!!!.
your ambient occlusion bake has a lot of artifacts. I recommend using xNormals to bake ambient occlusion that is way smoother.
You're right. The resolution of the baked map is really low. This was done in a few minutes. Maybe I need to update it with a sharper image!
Hi! I'm a new 3D graphics designer(using maya but have an idea of 3dsmax also). You say that you've created the model using 3Ds max, but how did u make it camera interactive?. So far i've found out about virtools but as i cna tell its not free, actually it seems to be WAY too expensive :/..is there any software as such that is freeware? thank you!
Thanks Paul, yes I am the guy. Glad you like it. Working on new updates as we speak!
Great!
Dear Klaas, I made a model with Sketchup and exported it to OBJ, could you maybe devote an article in the form of a simple explanatory as to why and how you go to work with 3ds Max? Also what is the best way to undo this mess with Sketchup and redo it and finish like the model you made?
Hi Albert :)Have you tried our SketchUp exporter?Best,*Alban Denoyel**Co-founder &amp; CEO*sketchfab.com@sketchfab &lt;http: sketchfab= twitter.com=&gt;*From the blog: Show your 3D skills in your LinkedIn profile&lt;http: 59393715537= blog.sketchfab.com= post= show-your-3d-skills-on-your-linkedin-profile=&gt; *&lt;/http:&gt;&lt;/http:&gt;
I can't click on the link, but if I remember correctly there is no sketchup for mac exporter. I have tried changing the textures but it hasn't given any result.
Just found out that there is an exporter for Mac, link is here http://goo.gl/lQnPmI. My model looks better but its not there yet, let me try the settings.

hey, I am just a journalist that want to use this model in her multimedia product. Is this an open source? is that ok to use this?
good!
still one of my favorites :)

Well, diffuse and specular took just a few minutes with DDo.

Hi
i would like to ask you something
how did you show the texture of your 3d model, i did zip the texture with muy 3d model, but the website doesnt show it

can you help

Hi!

Settings -> 3d settings
In the Materials tab click on any texture square,
you'll see the Texture manager button in the pop-up window.
Just upload your textures and plug them in.

That's the way I did it.
Maybe you should check their tutorial video, or even better use their exporter :)
Is it your design Slava?
Hi! Well, partly.
I started with Autobianchi Bianchina blueprints in order not to screw up the proportions).
So cute! Awsome work
Cutest model I've seen here :)
Thank you!
ur all about that pony bout that pony, no unicorns

Hey it seems like somebody has reuploaded your model, just using only your diffuse. Dunno how you feel about this?
Excellent Cartoon style!!!
In what software you make this ?
Hi! Modelled in Maya, textures made in DDo Legacy.
Btw, the 2nd one is free. You should try It, It's awesome!
Great work! Thanks for the free download!
nice thank you
I love your lovely pony car?And Thanks for the download,that's a very good reference for 3d modelling.

Love it! I want to check this with an Oculus.
excellent texturing and lighting! What render engine did you use? The AO is a bit strong but that could be the effect you wanted to add a surreal feel to it.  well done.
Thanks! If anyone interested,the final product can be seen here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPDrgA39PE
2shaderbytes thanks, i used vray. AO is a bit strong, but its kind of a habit for me, i add vray dirt to every shader.
@ruslans3d that looks amazing! You should add the link to the video and to the Google Play store in the model description. We support Markdown (see the editor for help) to you can create a nice layout.
Thanks, Bart! I will do it

Nice legs :-)

which application have you used to make this
Great to see the Xbox One annotated!
which software you are using to make this type of rendering
I feel very happy to see like this rendering. 
Nice modeling, especially the XBox One Controller which shape is quite difficult to render...
And the annotations are well chosen. Nice work !
Hi, you're part of our 3 year anniversary overview. Thanks for creating awesome art! :) https://sketchfab.com/3yearsold

Zooming on the kinect's grill kind'a gave me a scare, but awesome model anyways! Love how you made the spec on the controller!

Hey folks, please remember that Sketchfab is not a platform for political debates. Focus on the art please.
Historical piece !
is it possible to see the before image ? Could be great to compare them
wow! did you parse the video into screenshots? awesome work
Your model was featured as one of last week's Top Embeds!

I don't believe this is art. Pictures of this airport are not considered art, a 3D version doesn't make a difference. It's just journalism.
@mrgesy there's nothing wrong with journalism, is there? Nobody claimed this was 'art', many people use Sketchfab to share 3D scans.
@Bart true there's nothing wrong with journalism, I forgot that Sketchfab is a platform for all 3D media/information, not only 'art'. My bad :)
Sad, but this is what happens, when russia visits you!

Thanks for sharing. May I ask at what time exactly you published this on Feb 6th? I'm trying to get a sense of how quickly this model was produced and posted after the earthquake struck. Thanks again. More about me here: iRevolutions.org/bio
???????????????????????????????????????
My blog post on your project: 

http://iRevolutions.org/2016/02/07/aerial-robotics-virtual-reality-earthquake-taiwan
Hello patrickmeier, dean.hosp

All the data are collected from youtube, where Taiwan media using their UAV for collecting the scenario of this building  
This is a low resolution model that takes about 30 minutes
It was upload 10 hours latter after the earthquake strike
If I can fly myself, results can produce more fine and faster
Hi riddle0104, 
Would you mind also directing me to the youtube video you used for generating this 3D model?
Your help will be appreciated!
Hi Lisachen

No problem, but I suggested you using the following model

https://skfb.ly/KNpS

which is more fine and clearer
@patrickmeier very nice, thanks! No embed in the article though? :) WordPress now supports Sketchfab 'out of the box' - just put the Sketchfab URL in your article and it will expand into our viewer, just like YouTube videos etc.

@riddle0104 your work has traveled around the world, great job! Do you fly drones yourself too?
@bart 

Glad to hear from your common, I was surprised the news goes so very fast

This time all the images are converted from youtube video upload by Taiwan medias 

We do have rotary-wing UAV that already been used for collecting images of history building.
results can be found at @ncku_museum
Oh! So the other model was a drone capture? We were wondering about the difference in quality. Cool!
@Bart That out of the box feature does not seem to work on non-self hosted version of WP, alas. Any chance you can find a way around that? It sucks to have to take screenshots : )
@patrickmeier where are you hosting your WP? Wordpress.com does support us now, and any 4.4.2 version should, too. Maybe your version is not up to date?
@Bart Ah ha! It worked. Many thanks for making that feature possible, really helps. Have updated:

how u make the light on textures?  
Awesome work, really efficient use of textures. Keep the good work!
great work wow
Hi guys! Sorry it took me a long time to reply.For the software, I'm using 3ds max for modeling and V-Ray as the renderer plugin.The lights were texture baked, please check my blog for a brief rundown regarding the matter.I'm glad you liked my project. Thanks so much for the likes and inspiring words from you and the community.

Excellent! I love the ambient occlusion
Awesome! But why would a person with such a crazy house have an ordinary car? :)

Hi, in what software this is created ?
Unreal!
So beautiful!
Great
Would you be interested in collaborating?  I am wanting to show how NEODiVR can be used to interact with an architectural model. With NEODiVR you can literally walk up to the the gate and to the front door.  I have now done several conversion and my own models, but I am hoping to bring in more talented artist like yourself.  My workflow consist of taking models in what ever format you created them into Unity or Modo if the current textures have not been baked, and then either create Unity demos, or export as a Collada and into iOS Scenekit to for conversion into their scenekit format.

Here are a few demos of NEODiVR on YouTube:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnhoKrXoLPEhJ644BQBBKRdY8ADwwe3R

Haha, a wicked mohawk on Calvin!
SMART and cute-er :)
this is sick!
this is by far the coolest comic strip ever
@cpt.mcbacon thanks :D I'll try to make more :)
@Moshugan yeah ahah, his hair kinda defies all 3D representation xD
thank you so much @shadowfire168 , @iequezada , @jmolinamuscara :)
There are very few instances where using OMG! is allowed, this is one of them! 
Kudos to you Sir, I wonder how you did it, can you now bake textures from freestyle? 
I would kill to know how to do this, also you got the perspectives spot on, amazing work!
I think I figured it out, you have a wrap around mesh with normals pointing inside, its black so depending on the scale the thickness of the contour... right?
@eliut thank you so much! Please please don't kill anyone ahah, it's a pretty simple technique :) Yep you got it! it's commonly used in videogames, although it adds alot of polys :)
COMICS HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT!!!
\o/ the black bug on mac is fixed, I can finally staff pick this gem!!
This is amazing! I'm so impressed.
@BeakBlack I wish they were :p I think marvel is working on something like that, but imo it'll be more like parralax 3D and not full 3D ^^
@alban yay thank you so much Alban :)
@sophierobbins thank you!!
Just beautiful. I love how you've transformed it into 3D! Calvin's nose looks a tiny bit off, but that's more an observation. I still think it's perfect :D
Just wow !! I love it.
a work of art !! nicely done!
outstanding work!
You're on BlenderNation!

@nickpavlovsky Thanks! I used 3D coat and Photoshop for this guy.
@hansolocambo Thank-you Much appreciated :)
Man I would love to have a statue of this on my desk.

Just a tought : find a person that can make those into real life plastic statue's then sell them online. --> profit.
or sell the idea to blizzard.
:D just some advice.
Great skill you have in 3D coat.
Great work, Love it!
Great paladin set, love the improvements :D 
If they made this set id lvl my twink up just to get it
I wish the actual game armor looked this good.  I love it!

Would it be that hard to add all the little 3D elements that you have here to the current models to make it look like armor and not a painted on skin? Sorry, thinking out loud.
@Breetai If only. Any models (as with any game) have to stay within a certain triangle limit so there isn't a performance hit.
You were #on on reddit.com/r/wow yesterday! Check out the upvotes and comments - and your insane number of views :-)

https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5l4r6a/one_of_blizzards_3d_artists_reimagines_tier_2/
@bartv Crazy! Thats awesome, Im really pleased to see the WoW community loving it!
woow its fantastic good work

i want to know what is the program u used to make this

and can i do like it in blender and thankes
Is it hand painted?
@rayangame14 Thanks! 3D Coat and Photoshop  for textures, 3Ds Max for modeling.
@Revael Yep! 100% hand painted.
Awesome work Shem. I know this is a personal project and not official Warcraft art, but was it made to fit within the limits set for WoW?

Also what would be the limits for standard humanoid character within the game?
Is there a model i could download for this? I kinda want to 3D print this and use as my mini for D&D.
Someone else already asked, but I would love if I could get the 3d file to use for my personal d&d character. I have a 3d printer and this would make my year! I've been trying to find an alternative for it around the web and I haven't found anything really useful. 

I obviously wouldn't be trying to sell it for profit or anything because I know Blizz owns all the rights and such. I just want it for my personal d&d mini

Hi
i would like to know what files do sketchfab uses for this mesh animation?obj.sequence?alembic?i would like that!
Incredible! Great work :-)
I was trying to think if it was possible to do this. Looks like the answer has been proven to be yes!
Question:
Is this a single mesh where the vertexes are animated to conform to the form of different 3d scan frames? 
OR: is this actually a raw sequence of multiple separate model frames each with different mesh topology? In the later case sketch fab is essentially swapping though 100 different models sequentially.
wooow! amazing, how did you make this? which software did you use for this? and you write go pro, was this an array of go pros?
eatch it in matcap every body!!
Absolutely fantastic!
Really cool.
beggining of real matrix world. Amazing. I can not imagine the future of this. Awesome steps.
Kinda afraid what comes next with the technology...the beginning of real matrix.

Great stuff by the way.
thats amazing
Ultimately, is this FBX, Alembic, OBJ seq?  Awesome work!
Really fantastic

This scan is fascinating, but what I really loved is how you told the skull's story through the annotations. Thanks so much for sharing, I'm staff picking it!
Is this model available for download? I just want to make sure I'm not overlooking something.
Could you colaborate on how you used 2 different cameras without screwing the scan !?
Jules
@merckxiaan Hi Jules, I quite often use several different cameras as I shoot in situ. I've never found any problem aligning them in PhotoScan (always masked images), but sometimes I use chunks and markers. I haven't tried multiple cameras on any cloud based software, maybe @nebulousflynn has? This scan was done in two chunks, top and then bottom and chunks merged using markers. It took about 30 minutes to photograph and the model was generated by the next day with processing overnight. Hope that helps? Dan
hey @britishmuseum and @merckxiaan - I've not used two different cameras that much but I think PhotoScan is maybe more forgiving than other software. I think testing with ReMake (or similar) would require combining mask and image files i.e. blacking/whiting out the background completely in each image. I've not tried this though.
@chothoneill42 did you get an answer? Yeah, it seems like a lot of stuff is not downloadable. I'm hoping there is a way to download some of these

Very nice walk she is all woman
Thank you all for the comments!
The walking motion is captured with a real female performer from a leading mocap lab :)
I will add this sexy girl in my video game
I'm hoping to learn alot about 3d animation from her
@happy32x 
Don't hesitate to show us when it's ready!

@tinman042
There are many free resource online, or you can try to learn it from iClone. With its pre-made content and smart interactivity between actors and environment, you shall learn 3D animation fast than using other professional tools.

It loads completely, then it remains at the end of the bar. Doesn't show up. Remains blurry.
Anyone else has got the same problem?
I tried disabling my extensions, even tried other browsers.
@Deviated 
It's a bug on Sketchfab. They will fix it next week.
She has a great walk - Walking with joy - while listening to Thriller (singel version by Michael Jackson, :).
I like her and her moves. 
Good job
@ngnigami00 

Interesting point!
There was no background music playing while motion capturing, maybe the performer were thinking about Thriller while performing. :P
... I was just listening to that track via webbradio over Internet when Izzy was walking in the same pace as the rhythm from Thriller was playing and it was the same as Izzy (walking With joy).
:)
very beautiful :)
She can be a Gaming character!
hi how do i import in in unity
@happy32x how do you import it in unity
@6969papajohn6969 I use blender 2.79 and Unreal Engine 4.16, I don't know anything about importation on Unity 5
In unity 5.6 like previous you just create a folder for characters and after unzipping a file like this you can drag and drop it into that folder from wherever your unzipped file is at then drag the model from the character file into the scene hierarchy or directly into the scene, not the game mode preview.
BTW great model i can never get blender 7.9 to rig anything correctly.
Amazing work. Thanks a lot.
morph face and body shape is a nice function.

how did you get the model for fizz to be imported on blender?
I got the Fizz model by using RAF manager back when it used to work. I could then export Fizz as .skn and .skl files. Then I got a SKN-to-OBJ tool and it converted to .obj. Blender was able to import the .obj.
Think it would look great with the rest of the body finished.
It is finished. In-game, you wouldn't see past the neck, so the rest of the body wouldn't be needed.
Yeah that's cool I get what you mean but still would look cool as a completed model out of game.
yep. it'd be MASSIVE
nice model, nice game. worse community (LoL community). nah seriously, realy nice :)
How do you make glowing weapon enchant like that?
To make the glowy bits, I set up a plane and applied the texture onto it. The texture itself is a circular fiery color with transparency that gets more solid at the center. Then I copied the plane and rotated it by 45 degrees on the Z (top) axis. This was repeated 4 times...and boom...I had a glowy bit.
Just Epic, I also found video on youtube how to do it. I think this is it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBju2Kshtyg right?
@ultraevil Yeah, but with one less step. Instead of making the game engine say to the plane hey...point your face at their face at all times, I made duplicates of the plane and rotated the duplicates on different axes. It creates a sort of illusion halo
@dragon7350  Thank You m8

@luigiusai I know this is a bit late...but I do share my models if you make requests privately. I can be reached at snipermaster7350@yahoo.com. Just let me know what you'll be using it for.
compliment!! I love it!!
This is really cool!!I love it!!
Good idea
what is splash art and how do you do it?
@coolguy206 I think splash art is jargon for a digital painting showcasing a character in League of Legends specifically. You pick a character and you make a digital illustration exaggerating the character's personality.

I am really curious as to whom makes these models in the first place for Virtual Studio to post. I don't know if the account is a company thing or one person thing.


Anyway, I love this model and I'm looking forward to the Nintendo Switch in March 2017.
Can't wait for this model to be updated with the new elements we've seen! Really nice work so far already, I'm impressed!

@vynatic It is written in the description, in this case the model was done by shaderbytes for Virtual Studio.

@HighEndMe 
The model was done, similar to mine, on the day it got announced. Maybe there will be an updated version of it at some point :)
There is a new build of the model with updates all around , you can see it here :

This is amazing!! How did you make the shadow so clean? Which render software and shader did you use? Love your work so much!!
@h5136088 I use Maya Hardware 2.0 and solidShader (Painting shadow in texture). When uploading to Sketchfab, in 3D settings, I change shading from Lit to Shadeless. It will make any light and shadow disappear and show real color of your texture.

Very good job, would love to see more !
Thanks everyone! ^///^
Instrument reflections very well done.
Nice model. How did this your toon shader ?
Really great trick - no diffuse, just emission
How did you achieve this dou? : o No tutorial needed but if you could just underline your workflow steps or something I'd appreciate it.
@3rton - As far as I can tell, all the color is achieved with just emission and no diffuse, which lets the cartoon stay cartoon, even though the scene is lit, for the instrument's reflections.

Bake light per Vertex with a two tone shading ? Nice way to get a sharp light transition !
Great job !
Seems very hard to really control the light though.. is the light handpainted ?
null
Thanks everybody, I'll be doing a write-up on how I achieved this effect in a few days.
Good job doing that ! Can't wait for your explanation
Hi Poribo, which program of modeling that you used for created this character? Blender with NPR?
Really good job Poribo.
Is texture with the lighting ? Or it is a cell-shading shader ?
We recommended your work to IAMAG.CO and they featured it:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-62/

Congrats :)
For those who asked if it is a cell shading, turn on wire frame, it consists of two meshes with an outer offset of which the outer one has inverted normals, invisible backfaces and painted black, this is genius, I'm a fan.
WOOOOOO best 3D x 2D model.
fiu!!
You could create a tutorial ?

Just one word : Awesome ! Really really beautiful, congrats
I'm having a hard time adding annotations to this build because English isn't my native language, and I've never been to a cathedral in real life... D:
Annotations are great right now :)
Stunning, as always. Great work on the water. The tree transparency seems a bit buggy. I have trouble with Minecraft transparency, too. Any tips?
@PadreZippo I think the transparency bug has to do with the sketchfab engine, because it's fine on other 3D softwares. Hope you guys can find a way around it soon :)
@PadreZippo Or it might just be how the leaves model are exported that doesn't suit this rendering method.
@PadreZippo After inspection, I think it's the excessive seams and inner polygons that are messing up the render. I might have to find a way to fix that next time :\
Holy cow! How long does it take you to build such models?! Do you do it all inside Minecraft, or do you somehow import them?
@Bart It easier than it looks to build. You can just build one section of the hall or one quarter of the tower, and then use worldedit tool in server to copy and paste, rotate, or flip the sections in-game. It took me about a night or two to build the cathedral and about the same for the parkour route and combination lock.
Ah cool I didn't know you could do that. Did it also generate the shadows for you, or does Minecraft take care of that? I'm such a noob ;-)
@Bart No, I build it ingame, then cleanup the map in MCEdit, exported model with Mineways, unwrapped UV in ZBrush, baked various textures in 3ds Max, and final texture compositing in Photoshop. Jmc2obj is more popular for minecraft model export, but I get errors when using it :\
Holy Moses that's alot of cubes! Totally awesome ;)
really great! And I love the comments tread.
Thanks! :)
Wow.. i'm speechless... 
Cool voxel model.
wow cool with MINECRAFT?!
This makes me wanna learn how to do this stuff
You may not have seen a real Cathedral like this, but you may have remembered it from Assassins Creed.  
@bigpenna64 The parkour route was inspired from one of the assassin's tomb mission, but the architecture itself was a mix of various cathedrals referenced from googled pictures.
It's a little strange for cathedral architecture. Typically, the entrance would be at the other end of the 'nave' and the altar would be under the tallest tower (the 'apse').

@stephomi To make the skin texture as sharp and as detailed as possible, the graininess also helps the illusion of having fine pores and skin hairs. It's just a little trick I use when the texture res isn't high enough. However it might be too noisy to some people.

Oh Goddess
awesome anatomy
Me gusta maldita sea!!!
Will it sets sharing download?
@wewecat I've repacked & reuploaded the file, you can download it now :)
Amazing!! the skin is well created, and the effect of the hair around the body, aww.. it excite me jeje..
amazing detail and realism down to the fine body hair Totally impressed!
amazing!
Really awesome work!
@stephomi , the textures are so large and @patrix I noticed that you actually modeled tiny hairs all over the skin. Isn't that too much detail?
@grillswills After I replace the original fibermesh hair with optimized hair cards, I've saved hundreds thousands of tris-count. So I decided to add some fine hairs as a test, and the total tris-count ended up even less than before :P

The fine hairs are just a quick test, so the placement, lengths and density aren't very accurate :\
@patrix Thank you very much for sharing this great model??
i noticed the fur/hair used in her body wow the result are really tremendously nice.
thank you for your great modle
Need live pose
The hair distribution is a little odd O.O
For example, you could get rid of the hair on her panties....and usually most men dont even have hair down to their feet (usually stops above the ankles), hand hair usually stops at the wrist and on your face it usually goes across you cheeks and up to the tip of the nose and above the lips and finally, you can only grow hair on around your areola not on them XD O.O
Oh well, it's just that, otherwise i love iitttt :D
@neomax This is just a test upload, its pose is not really good for rigging. I will reupload if I make anymore changes or rigged for animation.
@radiated_monkey As I've said a few comments below you, the fine hairs are just a quick test, so the placement, lengths and density aren't very accurate.
Upload the two sheets test renderings ~
https://goo.gl/photos/K3UXSZ2Y4cn8ag4HA This is a focal length of 85mm
https://goo.gl/photos/Ebbn6KaYAB8CJAos7 This is a focal length of 45mm
@wewecat I suggest you change your lighting/exposure setup, and maybe add some SSS to the hair, or change the hair reflection to anisotropic.

Here's some of my quick test render with marmoset toolbag: http://imgur.com/a/62YDH

LED in eyes - good idea! :)
Holy...! Amazing!
That is so awesome!
How did you make the eyes LED, I'm new to this so I don't know much.
Thanks everybody for the support ! I really appreciate :)

@brandonclark : You need to use an Emissive map to get Self Illumination information.
Then in Post Process, go to the Bloom Tab and adjust the Glow Intensity to get the wanted result.
It's pretty easy to adjust :)
Enjoy !
Nice design :)
Living example of what good edge flow can do and how texturing is where is at.
Holy moly
Excellent work, I had to turn shadeless on to test how much of this was rendered to texture, Its a great merge of that and PBR on the metal areas.  Love the detail.

@alban 
Here we go. First scan that lock movement. At least it possible download mesh.

@britishmuseum 
228 photo? Is enough.
Just shoot most of them in macro. And pass to RealtyCapture and you will have mesh with letters not as picture but as high resolution details!

BTW, contact Capturing Reality directly, them have some good deals for NPO/University/Museums.
Awesome! :)
@ssh4 Hi Vlad, I can't run RealityCapture on my hardware, I'm on OSX and my work PC doesn't have the right graphics card or memory levels. 
The glyphs are really shallow, many of the images are shot on macro level and we only had an hour to work on the capture. The back of the model is shot through the glass case, so it came out better than I thought it would. Dan
Can we unlock the camera movement please.
@britishmuseum I know, that not my deal.
But if goal of your organisation is preservation cultural heritage OSX can't run is not an answer. ;)

Photogrammetry and OSX is not compatible for this moment. Thanx to Apple for this. AMD cards, that required 10x times more for coding in OpenCL, rather than in CUDA that better support by Nvidia.
As NPO i think you can easily contact both Bentley and Capturing Reality, and them easily provide free or huge discount for your project.
And this 2 best photogrammetry tool on market for this days.

BTW, if you have Nvidia on your Mac you can make dual boot and install windows https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201468
But much easier built cheap PC with old 900x GTX cards, that will outperform Photoscan in speed and in quality.
Even monitor is not needed, setup windows, run VNC or Teamviewer and use it for Photogrammetry only.

Bentley ContextCapture will work better with low quality images. RealityCapture will much better but you will need high quality images or shoot 2-3x times more for improve quality (even in this case RC will faster than other).
Dude; y'all have been posting some epic pieces of history here, but I've been waiting for this one ever since I learned about this site.  This is completely awesome; please keep up the most excellent work!
This is a fabulous example of making important parts of the patrimony of all mankind available to anyone worldwide. Photographs are always great, but nothing conveys information like a three-dimensional model that can be manipulated. Thanks for sharing your work. I'm always looking forward to the next item you'll be sharing.
Good first go, but the camera angle is locked onto 0,0,0 - e.g., you can't zoom in to the Egyptian section of the stone.  There is no horizontal or vertical move function.  Please add that so we can actually examine all writing on the stone.
@allanvalmck you can drag the stone around the viewer. Press shift and click on the stone and drag down to where you want to view.
@britishmuseum Thank you!  Shift click, OK.  Perhaps you can just state such on the page so people like me don't have to bother you with UI questions.  But great job, thanks!  And now, how about the rest of the Egyptian collection so we can have a look at all the hieroglyphs?
Great work! thanks. Only a question about texture resolution in Photoscan: what resolution have? (4096 x1 or more) or is a tiled model? thnks
@sastun1962 4096 x 1
This is awesome! I just saw the real stone back in June - Amazing!
Beautyfull !!!

Hi, is there any way that you could make a low poly version of this while maintaining the texture? I'm attempting to make this out of paper.

Hey great work....
@BlackBoxL, Thank you :)
thank a lot :D
Awesome job! How did you get animated morphs into Sketchfab? Did you model the morphs in Zbrush and if so can you export then into Sketchfab?
Thanks @rubyrieke , I've created the morphs in Zbrush, then imported them to Cinema 4d, animated them and the uploaded to sketchfab along with the texture maps.
@docjana @docjana  Thanks for the info!  I can't wait to try some morphs out too
@monsterhouse Thank you very much. I am glad you appreciate it.
Well done, I appreciate your focus to detail.

did you have vertex ration ? :)
Looks great, but to many places to correct.... 

Every corner has too visible seam, so UV made not in the best way.
Diffuse\albedo maps are killing normal map. Normal is seen only in matcap on all items exept walls.
Pipes are very round on not visible side, and low-sectioned on visible.
Tent/Garage to the left of the bulding has no thickness. It's wall are made from 1 face, so in game engine you could look through them. But all barrels and boxes (begind the house) all have many bottom faces.
fabulously cool

This is amazing! 
love the style and animations you added, So glad this got a staff pick!
YES! Thank's for uploading this! I love the crystals and the birds.
Fantastic! Loved following the progress of this model as well as your other work. You really got talent telling stories with your artworks!
Holy waw! I don't think I've ever actually liked a 3D model this way; I mean, not at all for the technical achievement and wholly because it's just nice to look at. I'm pretty certain this is the best 3D thing I've ever seen since digital 3D exists.
This is so good it's freaky!
WOA! Amazing work! Congrats!!!
Amazing. Just absolutely amazing! And inspiring! Now I wanna do this!
Wow!!  LUV it!  Brilliant!
Absolutely amazing.
This is now among my favourite work here on Sketchfab! I love the whole scene, and how you added a bit of idle animation too.

Dat Booty.

This is not cel shading effect.
It is the polygon in the polygon  ,outside of the polygon ?Reversal
Outside of the polygon  looks like a cel shading effect:)
?Excuse me,I don't have a good command of English and can not explain in detail. ?

really cool!!! good work man:)
thanks guys
I grew up playing Malphite a lot and ended up being my favorite.  I've been wondering if Malphite would ever get a visual update and this certainly has passed any expectations to what Malphite should look like.  This truly embodies Malphite and I hope riot will take this up for his new design.
thank you so much :')
His in-game scaling looks just about right too knowing Malphite is a 4 story tall, 90 ton hulking giant.  It suits him to be just as big as Sion or bigger to clarify his intimidating tank/brute like game play.  Really hoping they will consider this for his new visual.   Again, meritorious work.
I totally agree with the size thing, all though I know there are many things that don't go with the LoL style on him (in retrospective maybe I should have just adjusted to their style haha) anyway, thanks again. <3
Nice model dude!!! Really liked

I've been having alot of work to do, so I haven't been able to upload any new personal work, but soon.
Epic.
Wonderful! I like how you include different poses and the materials looks very nice.
Poses are great. I'm curious cause i've seen this on a lot of Riot related things. Do they no use Normal/Spec Channels? It seems like the lighting and detail is almost entirely in the Diffuse Channel. I've been considering LoL or DoTA for my next project after the Tallonite Weapons for EQ2 and Skyrim.

What did you use to make this diorama?
Thanks for the kind words everyone!

The diorama was modelled and unwrapped in 3DS Max, then textured in Photoshop (mostly loads of small tiling/trim textures). The characters were textured in 3D Coat.
this is fucking nuts :O

@maiminase
thanks for your comment!
This model consists of diffuseTex and lineTex.

@texar
comment Thanks!
I want to the remodeling for the data to figure model.
ok  no proplem I can do after  modeling
how can you gen such a amazing 3d model? which software you used plz? and where can I learn this?
@satomic
thanks for your comment!
Desire to three-dimensional to 2Dcharacter is the driving force of my work.
is this for download
so amazing.. how on earth did you manage to balance the front and side looks on her anime face...
most 3D anime model usually had only good looking on the front side but very distorted when look on the left side or right side..
@k7539518246k 
Sorry, there is no plans for now.

@Ryua
When modeling the face, be careful of the jaw line and cheek swelling. I hope it will be helpful.
what a great tribute to the anime! well done man
Really nice model.

Since I couldn't private message you: 
I'm the developer of AIGE And PWLib (a Gyakuten Saiban fan case creation engine), and i'm interested in this model to use as a demonstration for the engine's 3D capabilities (though photos and video). The model won't be distributed with the engine and will only be used for demonstration purposes.

Great project and perfect use of Sketchfab as a communication tool. I am an architect and we are proposing some farmbots for a project in Ecuador. Finger crossed!
Does anyone know where I can get the dimensions of all the plates etc from as well as the .STL files for 3d printing. I have access to all the materials I just need shaps and Dimensions to be able to do this project

How to did you do the shadow under the car?
ZipMatch, There is a plane underneath the car XD And really nice work!
Thanks, nice work Stephen :)
Absolutely outstanding. Really really nice work. Very impressive.
Thanks for the comments!

The shadow is indeed a plane with ambient occlusion baked to texture and used as alpha blending mask.
Thanks for that  KMiklas :)  It's very nice, congrats!
Amazing !

Fidelity off the chart.

@odelotappe-3959yopmail.com Its a car from the old world which has been redesigned on the cheap to be a hover car. Use your imagination.
ive used this in VRchat as avatar
@AxonSOs Can you tell me more? I'm curious. What is VRchat?
Its a vr game were you get to speak with people and can use 3d models as your avatar.
@karolmiklas Its a vr game were you get to speak with people and can use 3d models as your avatar.
@AxonSOs Cool! Can you send me some screenshot?
@karolmiklas ill try take a screen shot but the game is only fron first person so i can see only bonnet of the car but you can try it yourself its free on steam to download and you dont need VR to play it.
WOW) 
Can you tell about maerial creation process?) Maybe a link to tutorial or something ?
Thank you)
Back in the future ?
You are using photogrammetry or do you simulate manually?
@kennethhoward I don't use photogrammetry, usually I follow blueprints, photos or general proportions and dimensions.

Awesome model yo
i love the pic
shame that this is most faved model right now)) 
i am from china. So i do not know how to use,who can help me?
Very shiny indeed!

For everyone who wants to know how to use these reflections: on your model page, click Settings, then 3D settings. Enable environment options and add a reflection map. That's all :)
Muy buen acabado y visualización del 3D, me gusta mucho!
COOL

perfect work.
como cargas las texturas ?
I've gotta say I don't like iphones, but this is just magnificent....
Hi Mestaty
How do we create a shade under a model Just like your I phone model
Ugly
@fredrik please try to be constructive if you feel you need to leave feedback
the model is actually quite magnificient. I appreciate your attention to detail.

@justinchirammal switch to wireframe mode and you'll see how he's created that shadow. its a simple png mapped on a plane :)

@fredrik if you dislike iphones (like i do) please say that.. theres no need for the arbid hate speak.. sketchfab is one of the few communities that doesnt have that yet.. lets keep it that way.
great job. Impressive care of details. 
Keep up the level... and congrats
cool

It has some transparency issues though - fix those and I'll staff pick it :)
@Bart i'm not sure what the issue is, i've checked everything on my end and the flicker happens only from some angles, so i'm not sure if there's a way to fix it.
Great model!

Splitting the transparent parts into several geometries might help for the opacity issue.
Just heavenly!
@vermilionwlad , Are the transparent sprites on a different object or in the heads mesh ? The bug can come from the fact you have just one object for the head and sprites, no ?

Thank you, I'm very grateful!
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!
Amazing work for sure!
Nice job!
I love the hair, how do you generate such nice curls ?
Very realistic and also alive. I wish in the future you were making 3D models for my android females.
Really nice, and usefull head. hank You
Nice work, really beautiful ! I will use your model to make some image for my project. I will send them soon. 
Share me your facebook if you wish
Hi niki - great model. I notice that the .mtl file isn't packaged with the zip download so the obj doesn't render properly in Meshlab. Not causing me any problems at all, just wanted to let you know.
Very nice thank you
beautiful work, well done
Nice
She is amazing. Especially her hair is great! I would be so glad if you could give us some hints how you created these hair geometry. Well maybe it is simply creating it by hand. But maybe you know a smarter way :))
Awesome model and very cute too.... The skin shader looking mind blowing. Very nice work.
I can't see this model anymore O_o
Looks like you re-uploaded the models and lost your materials? (just to make sure we didn't break anything)

Thank you @Ivanix88
Flawless!
@rybak  Thank you!
I'm seeing major shadow bias issues... is that on my end somehow or is that how this was authored (just trying to learn more about the process and how to make the best looking stuff).
@tommywright It's my fault when I want to increase the intensity of light to create a contrast, There is a white streak in the character. 
To adjust the light you should use environmental light as the mainstream, the extra light is just small and mainly to clarify the detail you want, the side light should not be too bright. 
Post process effects should be just enough to clarify what you want, should not be too much, that is my opinion. 
Thank you for your interest in my product. 
Have a nice day! 
(Sorry for not good at English)
I love this. I'm staff picking it :)
@bartv Thank you :D

Just a few quick presentation tips: I would use a plain color background (1st editor tab), I would add a baked AO ground shadow (2nd editor tab), and some light post process (like depth of field, sharpness, saturation...)

I cannot properly import this fbx into blender, since it is ascii format. I converted with fbx converter to binary and can get the meshes in but the animations and skeleton is lost, as well as any materials. Anychance you can provide a binary version, or collada with materials too? Thanks!
magnificent example to study on. Beautiful
well done.
AWESOME!!!!
Great!
cant use this for unity as there is no animation file then you say it has animations put them with the download of the fbx that would be good

Kind of yes, here is the presentation of the work: http://www.re-creation.us/wax-...

Great anatomical model for educational use.
Good job!
@John it would be very cool to see our new annotation feature tested on this model :)
Thanks for the suggestion Alban. Great feature.
Great to see this heart now with annotations!
Fantastic, and true to wax models I've seen before. 
Re: annotation 2.- should this be a 'bronchial' tube?
@Ritasodontology Oops! Thanks for catching that, you're right. Fixed!

Thanks a million! You did an awesome job!
Can you please make it available for DOWNLOAD. I'd like to light it in different ways in Blender.
Excellent
I would love to buy this.
Any price for a model :D
I would like to buy this model.
for the people that want to buy this model- i dont think he is allowed to sell it since the asaro head has a copyright.
excellent work!
this is incredibly well done! would love to see a version where both halves are the simplified side and one where both halves are the complex side. never seen that done with asaro before.

Can I ask if you used the standard or pro version of Photoscan?  Thinking of giving it a try.
Thanks for the comments/questions. The model was created using the pro version of Photoscan. We have no plans to make it downloadable at the moment but this might change in the future.
Brilliant clarity.
This is so interesting. Thank you so much for posting it online for all of us to see, as this is a very relevant archaeological discovery. The state of his column... wow!
Hey - we featured your model in our review of 2017 on the Sketchfab blog:
https://blog.sketchfab.com/2017-in-review

Thanks for sharing your skills with our community and we look forward to seeing more great work from you in 2018 :)

@Shoctopus @Vernon45 
I haven't done it myself (too cheap for that VR set), but there's plenty of guides about this on youtube, say for example this one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyqecP2mn0c
This is the cutest Walk Cycle I've ever seen! Well Done.
@wardd thanks for that
Anyone knows how to make him walk like that in vrchat?
how do you download off this website
@xxxsansxx There is a DOWNLOAD button right under the publisher's name! :3c
Too many vertices for VRChat, apparently. It needs to be reduced to 10k-20k.
@rhapsody The model only has 7k, last time I checked, but I can upload a low-poly version later
anyway i could get this walk cycle?
The rigging doesn't contain jaw structure and yet the mouth is moving in this demo. Could you make an upload with jaw rigging?
dam this so fast
dead meme
@Christopher.Oake 
The walk cycle is included in the FBX file, it's called Armature|ArmatureAction though
I'm still trying to get my head around this whole Ugandan knuckles thing.
Hey can I download this model and put it in my new game im currently making I will make sure to credit you da wae Sketchfab credit artist.
do you kno de wae?
@sleepwalker77 they're basically quoting/parodying Wakaliwood's movie Who Killed Captain Alex?, however I don't know the origin on using the knuckles model.

whoa!!
Very nice. A few new Sketchfab features in this that I hope will make it through to the user end e.g audio, static positioning, probably more too. Are any of these available to all right now?
Wow, this  turned out incredible! Share it with everyone, it's one of the coolest things I ever saw on Sketchfab! :O
A huge thank you and shout out to Sketchfab community members @qarlos @gracemojica and @paulsrage for their incredible work on this project!
@maritimearchaeologytrust Yep - audio support is now live for everyone on Sketchfab including 2D and 3D-positional audio. Learn more here:

Awesome! That's so cool. Thanks Bart :D
Can't believe my eyes :o :o :o , Best thing i've ever seen !! 
but can i ask how you rendered it to look like a 2D image ? 
thanks
@haniissa - I used the diffuse map in the emission map slot with it set to the highest value - which means the diffuse cannot be affected by shadow. I also used a middle grey colour to light the scene instead of a background image. Keep your eyes out for my making of blog post. I will explain in more detail :)
Very beautiful work. Its remind me LIMBO artstyle
@manikseth - i heart LIMBO so much... def something i try to draw inspiration from all the time!

over 1000 views! oh my gosh, i feel the love - thanks guys!
this is more than a model.. its an experience!! great work
nice work!
beautiful!!
This opens a whole new take on modeling.
thanks for the kind words everybody! I really appreciate all the positive feedback :)
Very cool artwork. The game looks promising.

About the rendering, instead of using an emissive map, switching to shadeless may also work.
Hey Maurice, thanks for the kind words! I did toy with shadeless but I like using emission as you can control a slight amount of shading, just to make the trees stand out a bit more. Yes the game looks great, I can't wait!!
love everything i've seen so far of this game
Very beautiful
Wow, looks very good.

woooaaoo (y) !
very seriously done nice job !
Wonderful regisstration of the statue.....Nice example for a reproduction in a mobile theater...
Any word on allowing for people to 3D print the model?
Boa noite! Excelente trabalho! Sou estudante de Sketchup e Cinema 4D! Gostaria de saber se vocês podem disponibilizar o arquivo OBJ ou SKP?
This needs to be shared my friends.  Can we print this?  Model available for sale?  I want to make these for my sons.
Don't bother publishing your 3D models if you don't share them

@paulchambers3d Thanks Paul! :) Sorry, but it seems there has been some problem and it has not registered as staff pick :(
Fixed! Thanks! :)
great!
Hey this is great! I'm a student - am I able to download this as a collada file? Thanks :)
@miekeroth Thanks! :) 

@dazappa Sorry, model is not available for download. Maybe in future! :)
Can i download this? would be awesome, to print it 3D
Please download stl
These models are business. You shouldn't ask for free models with this level of quality. It takes a lot of work to make something like this.  

Maybe they are for sale on their website and maybe there are already 3d prints available that you could buy. Just take a look over there I would suggest. And if you want an stl file of a model like this: try to make one yourself.
@miekeroth 
You are mistaken if you think that I do not value people's work.
At no time did I order a free model
I can assure you that I was looking good on your two web sites and did not find stl for any site I found 3D models that is not what I need, I am looking for resources for young artists, and I would like to make some real models for them to learn
I am very well informed of the work that it costs to realize a 3D design and of the little that is valued the design and the sculpture, you do not know the life of the people, do not judge
So educational! Thank you for posting this. It is a great motivation to study the facial musculature, and I love how you included the origins/insertions and the functions of the muscles! One minor spelling error I noticed: orbicularis oris is showing up as oribuclaris oris.
Great work!
god of anatomy
excellent work, visit our website we can publish your work and that many more people know, we are developing an educational 3d encyclopedia and you could help us

Hi does anyone know if the creator sells these models please
There is a mistake at number 13 Oribuclaris Orisshould be called Orbiculares Oris.

Stunning Work. Just wondering why you chose to not have it for sale/download, as the work is truly one of a kind

@garfieldhang To me it seems that people have really latched onto the model, you're one of the few who can make stunning fan art to this level, after some looking, I haven't seen any that compare to what you've done here.
Personally, I would suggest you put it up for download, but hey, that's just my opinion
Really great model, as a pretty big fan of Zero Two myself I really have to say that this is really well done! Great job!
@ZeroTsu Thank you!
Amazingg!!!!,

awesome work, and it´s so fun to jump inside the mouth of the beast.
This is absolutely stunning. I love how you took the time to model the innards of the throat, the extra detail in the semi transparent tissues of the mouth and flesh. The drool which looks like I could touch it and come away sticky handed. Amazing work and the level of artistry - just WOW!
That's awesome, the triple S in the innards of the nose are awesome.
PERFEEEEEECTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful!
ZOMFG HOW DO I GET IT!! I would really like to get this so i can 3-d print it. My company logo is smaug him self so it would be great to have this on my office wall.

Merci Romain ;-)
(the original is even better, all the labels are readable ; here the textures are so much compressed that they aren't readable any more ; the loading speed does have some disadvantages).
Beautifully and detailed scanned machine!
Wow I hardly see any artefacts. Did you clean this up a lot?
No cleaning up at all.
I only compressed the textures (as discussed with PadreZippo). It might be worthwhile posting the compression method on the forum : great increase in loading time, with little reduction in quality;
Wow ! Amazing photogrammetric skills here ! That's the way to master Smart3DCapture. By far the best results I have ever seen for this kind of application.
Impressive!!!
Congrats Philippe, this is amazing, and a great showcase of the Acute3D capabilities! Now I just wish to see it annotated :)
Ha ha ! Toujours plus, Alban !
Yes, it's a pleasure working with Smart3Dcapture's last release, it really does a beautifull job !
I'm not good enough at aeronautics to annotate it yet, but I'll try... someday :-P
Btw this model really reminds me of the @fox3D starship, I did a side by side comparison here  https://jsfiddle.net/m01zyxqs/1/embedded/result/ :)
Fantastic! Love the loading time ;)
@alban : That's true, they do look alike... except that they're back to front w/r to one another :-D
@PadreZippo : following our discussion I abruptly downsampled the textures from 8k to 2K each (which means /16 !).
wooow!
Fantastique, Philippe!!

All the previous comments say it all except..............Come to London!! :-D
Thanks Andy. I will... eventually
I'm still a bit curious about the non-square textures coming out of acute
this is beautiful
@ PadreZippo
It's fairly simple (in my understanding : I have no official data from Acute). A number of 8k x 8k files are gererated according to the required number of pixels. If the number of pixels required fills less than one 8k x 8k file, then a 8k x 4k, or 4k x 4k, or 4k x 2K... is used instead. And of course, if it doesn't fit in one 8kx8k, but two is too much, it can also be one 8k x 8k, plus one 8k x 4k (for example).
this is really awesome
incredible, very helpful reference!
looks brutal !
HOW DID YOU DO THAT? (i bet its not made from sketch fab lab)

What an amazing model!
I would love the exhaust to be modelled up to the (single) turbo.
@miekeroth @paulchambers3d much love <3

@arnero It will be. I also plan to make the full interior and the engine (it gonna take some time though).
WOW
Best!
This is what I call quality!
null
Awesome model and exellent topology!
Super, man!
This is one incredible model and presentation. Congrats!
When you say you did the shading with geometry normals do you mean that you edited them by hand or that you used standard techniques to influence the shading like putting loops closer to each other to influence the shading etc? I'm just trying to clarify because the description made it sound like there was some special technique used that I should probably know about. Thanks.
Also, there is a polygon on the back of the valve stem that is colored green instead of black. It's the very top-most face loop closest to the green cap. This car turned out very, very nice and I'm looking forward to the interior.
@rpinto3d @fomenko @egelsky @devsanterr @marincastefan @comrade1280 @gmaaailgrisha Thanks!

@stevenb It is smoothed normals with supporting loops. There is no shading solved by normal maps except for the tires. Thanks for pointing out that green bit, it hid itself pretty well.
It's finally here and it looks glorious!

I love the metallic brown paint choice. Real nice touch with the water droplets and streams on the surfaces too!

The only thing I can really nitpick is that there's no ao baked for the tires (which, looking at the side walls, look otherwise amazing btw).
@ollitei Glad you like it!

Apparently there is an AO on the tires, it's just I made it subtle enough to not look over contrasted.

Or if you mean that they pop out from the black... then yeah. Not much I could do about it and keep the textures reasonable for game engines (they would be quite useless with such an AO baked in).
Amazing !
@karolmiklas I understand. I often bake an ao for presentation's sake though because it just looks so much better.
You could include the more rotation-friendly ao in the texture package.
Amazing... Love the plate!
just...WOW
This is fantastic, I love the water effects.
i only can say 1 word, WOW!
Guys please tell me it is possible to put these models in the cliff house?
Thanks
@codexito @Sean-Baker @wertanisaber @alban @mateuszwarian Thanks!

Just wow!!
Amazing !
are you modelling every polygon by hand? how is this possible?
Some great piece of modelling right here :) Also, is it just me or a mesh of a body of the car is doubled in viewer?
A beautiful model of a beautiful vehicle. Nice!

Superb model! ;)
Now *this* looks fantastic!
@RalphEdenbag @kryik1023 @ieva_lickiene @RalphEdenbag @inspired2150 @inspired2150 @_Vlad @doncha_magoso @fedbe59 Thanks!

@arteral It's subdivision surface modeling.
@RalphEdenbag What about it? :)
@comrade1280 The second layer is clearcoat (transparent, 100% glossy material). This is how you can achieve metallic or pearl paint in Sketchfab
Amazing detail !
Amazing! Great quality and so natural. Like it :)
What a beauty, thanks @karolmiklas for sharing! Gets my staff pick.
@Serjogasan @vertexdesign @alban <3
So good!
fav!
SUPER AWESOME!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!! I WILL study the fbx intensively!!
Great! Thank you for sharing. I study more:)
Amazing model and superb visualization. Loved the old vibe it has!
Wonderful work! Thank you!
boss level!!
Old and beautiful car
Bad model, very bad. You have so much geometry issues that i even can't imagine, how did you create it. Wrong proportions, wrong shapes.
Very nice! ?

Wow that's awesome! We've just started playing around with new forum software and some of us have started posting our Nintendo Fan art there, would you care to post yours, too?

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/share-your-nintendo-fan-art-here/31
Amazing ! I love it !
Thanks for the awesome feedback peeps! I'll post it over on the fan-art thread in a mo. Cracking timing
Perfect! *o*
Absolutely amazing job and execution!
Lovely attention to detail! Brings back memories of the Mattel Mighty Max toyline, even :)
Just curious, could you merge your meshes and put your textures into a 1k atlas? I think it would perform much better on the site.
Absolutely stunning piece of art!!!!!
Thanks for all the kind words everyone! @PadreZippo I could've squashed some of the textures into an atlas map, but a lot of the textures tile, so it can't be done for those unfortunately.
Fantastic! great work once again ;)
it is a amazing work, your models are growing to mre impressive than before. congrats =O
Super cool ! Love it :3
You're so creative with your sets, I love those boos on the roof. This one is probably my favourite.
Awesome :-)
I'm replaying Luigi's Mansion with the kids now. Exploring your scene is SO good :)
Ah ah ah ! Very cool ! I love Daisy valentine and Barry wario . Always a pleasure to see your scenes !
Looks like a ton of work. So much fun looking around in it!
Thank God

Cool!
Good lord this is a visual feast.

@bartv Yeah, I finally finished this model I´d been working on since long time ago.Thanks for that ,it´s great.
@rybak @iggy-design @jkaspar Thanks, I am very glad you guys like it.
awesome.. someday i will make like this style XD
WOW!, Great technique with the fake Line Render. I Love the Style.
11/10  masterpiece
amazing... again...... :)
Beautiful. Love your illustrative style and the sense of narrative.
Great! Maybe too much blurry?
Buah! Es genial!! Me encanta este diorama, todos los detalles que tiene...

Me pregunto si podrías hacer un minitutorial sobre como hacer trabajos así! Al menos en cuanto al tema de textura y demás... Me encantaría aprender, pero hasta ahora todo lo que encuentro está en inglés y casi que no explican nada.
Me está costando bastante :(
Have to agree with the Blur being a little too much, but that's minor - I really love the style! Great job :)
creepy creepy
This is inspiring! :) Great technique and style!
Great Work
Would love to see a movie about this. Really creative!
wuau
Amazing technique! It´s genius how you did that double mesh for the outlines, I´m amazed =D
@nomadking @gmaaailgrisha  You´re right, I already fixed it. Thanks.

Hi Mito,

this is a preview of our new simplified 3D mesh functionality.
Pix4Dmapper 1.3 will include this functionality, and is targeted to be released by end of 2014.
Hi Pix4D,

Wich Format are you using to include color in your 3D Model ?
I have made a few test with .OBJ and .3DS but none of them allow color...
Here is an example : https://sketchfab.com/models/69f5a090b517443ea4353d6aa67cc7a6

Thank you for your help !
Cloud points are very useful! congratulations, since my childhood I love this Castle!
It's our pleasure!! 
If you'd like to know more about this project look here: https://pix4d.com/chillon/
Or see this article that came out this week: http://www.geoconnexion.com/publications/geo-international/issue/june-2015-international-issue/article/castles-in-the-sky
Amazing.!!!
very good
Great work!
Love this example and am constantly experimenting with Pix4D for archaeological and heritage buildings. Very inspiring.

Its perfect! Can u explain the process to get it?
I am going to use this in a freelance game I am making in Unreal Engine I will be sure to credit you and Send you a link.
Oh thanks a lot, I was looking for this for s surgeon simulator-type game for a place hold at the moment untill one of our 3D artists has a model for us.
This is really nice topology! I'm going to use this to study hands.
Awesome topology, its perfect!
Fantastic little mesh! Handy reference piece to look at=)
So clean!
nice topology flow gud work
does this deform well?
I just finished rigging this up, if anyone wants that version just message me. (warning, I'm not a great rigger, so its pretty messy)
Beautiful in it's structural simplicity.
Great render!
you are a got dang life saver you
This topo is brilliant
@jonahkelsey long shot but do u still have the rigged version of this? would love to have it
How come this model hasen't been triangulated when uploaded to Sketchfab?
Thank you! Very useful reference for learning how to model hands!
Obrigada
Thanks, very handy, excuse the pun
@jonahkelsey Hi there, I would love to get the rigged version of this if you still have it!
Simple model. But available if rigged.
@jonahkelsey Hello! Do you still have the rigged version available? I would love to have it!
Anura, thank you a lot! youve saved a tonn of time! realy cool model. Will try to find something to upload here.

great model! has no problem with convertion and in rendering with the right ambient occlusion it is really porfect
nice model, appreciate!
Hmmm, can't seem to get this model to open..
@bradfordkelley From time to time I encountered the same problem too. If you're on a Mac, the utility Keka usually does the trick.
Excellent model, trouble with left arm on first try, have added temporary support from hip to elbow looking forward to next print.

Masterpiece!

Great job! Love the style and rendering! Extremely impressed as always.

Had a question about the hair: It seems that the outer planes have reversed normals so that you only see the outer hair layers in extreme angles or profile, is it intentional or have the normals been flipped the wrong way? Thanks!

@abbe its intentional! that way I only have to use one card with small texture pace to break the silhouette up!
@james thank you!

@Natedavi who know what the future brings :)

@seori Hi I think I am done messing with this one for now! :)
Amazing work! Really love how this turned out.
@MeatMonkey Thanks! :)
I really love this! When it loaded, I saw the animation line before I saw the animation and thought it might be too much. But it's a perfect subdued gesture.
@miekeroth Thanks, yea definitely want to keep the movement subtle. :)
This is lovely! I've shared it with the Mauritshuis museum where it's on exhibit.
Holy crap this is super awesome :O <3 love it!!

Awesome!
Another fantastic model! I feel though that you may have put this into too many categories - if you could only pick two, what would they be?
@2dand3d Thanx! Glad you dig it! :D
@igroman92 Thank you! :)
@bartv Yeah I agree. It is sort of all encompassing,depending on its potential use... i think the nearest two selections would be animals and gaming.  On the other hand, weapons,cars and science categories would be the farthest ones. 
And thanx,really glad you like it! :)
Yeah this is a hard one to classify :) I like animals and gaming though - could you update your categories?
@bartv Done! Thanx for the hint! :)
Thanks man :)

Shimashima, kuma-san, ichigo, haato, hana, hoshi, pinku, cheeri...
amazing <3
love it
Your scale and position is all wrong in VR. The model is huge and very far away and floating in the air.
The face looks good from from, but terrible from side.

@hansolocambo What? I don't see anything happening at 32s?? The pants change every few seconds throughout the entire 34s, nothing else.
@hansolocambo OK I see what you mean... seems to be some sort of random thing though... doesn't happen me at 32s but just happened once at 27s. Then can't repeat it. No idea, might be sort sort of rendering bug where the texture disappears for some reason...
good
good
@geogan I was able to get it to trigger between any of the transitions but pausing the animation and manually scrubbing back and forth between transitions and sometimes it will just not render... O.o
Congratulations!, good work!.

Thank you so much !
Scan quality with nice and clean geometry!
Thank you E Lynx !

It's not a scan, by the way, I've drawn the maps too ! ^^
Yea i can tell u modeled and textured it as 3d scan models look horrendous with wire-frame. Awesome work!
Thank's it's encouraging !
Did you paint the texture for that armchair as well ?:o
Hi Astarroth !

Yes, for the Armchair I started with a simple polypainting on Zbrush, and then I've unwrapped it to continue with Photoshop.
Really impressive!
Thank you so much Alejandro Santell !
Putting your signature in the specular map is a classy touch.
Thank you systmh. Before Sketchfab, I tried some home made WebGL.
I used a similar method to highlight the wireframe who was drawn on the diffuse map.
The effect was classy too ! :)
hey how'd you put that picture in your description? Also this is scary good, great work dude
Hello lawlordp, you can find these information on this page :

Random done the things well !
Wow. Dude!

At first glance I said... looks great, but just another 3D scan.

zoomed in.... saw perfectly crafted detail

Can we get a Tracer model
Is it possible to  convert this model to .obj format?
Yes.
wow great!
wow!!
https://skfb.ly/OyGB
https://skfb.ly/OyGB
How do you convert this in obj ?
Use GCFScape to decompile the .vpk file, then use Crowbar to decompile the .mdl file. Import the .smd file with the importer/exporter script either on Blender, Autodesk, 3ds Max, etc.
how do you download this files? It says download has started but there's nothing downloading in progress :(
This is not my problem. Could be either your browser or Sketchfab itself.
thanks its nice
Espectacular! haré el mejor colplay. Mil gracias.
am I allowed to use this for a youtube video if I give credit to you?
Go ahead.

ps: looks really nice in VR too :) https://sketchfab.com/models/b9f6dc4ace8f4edc8e136cb5ec33cc97/embed?oculus=2
Bart, 
Thank you so much for staff picking it :).
I can make it better its just a test
Alban,
Wow, I wish if I have a VR device. 

General speaking, the work flow is simple so simple for any 3ds max and Vray users:

- I rendered the space using some advanced vray settings.
- once I liked the results, I started to unrwap each object. (walls, floor, chair......)
- then I started to back the textures for each unwraped object using render to texture in 3ds max.
- I use vray complete map in the output options.
- saved the file to fxb and uploaded to archfab with the backed textures. 
 
But in reality there is some problems that you have to deal with to make it better...noting that this is only a test.
@tarekadhami would you be interested in writing a quick tutorial for our blog on that process? I'm sure it could be very useful for many artists! Contact me on bart@blendernation.com to discuss :)
nice room. I might want to collaborate with you to put this into VR. My email is jason@viralmarketing.biz
Great work! 
would love a tutorial:)

Congrats we selected your model for this article in ArchDaily: http://www.archdaily.com/782972/7-examples-of-how-to-show-off-interiors-in-your-3d-models-as-selected-by-sketchfab
Brilliant! Great job.

awesome
Great!!!! The only issue the scale when you wear VR glasses...you have to re scale the scene...whith Lightwave the scale is 100/1. With Max...I'm not sure.
The other big issue: It looks so real I almost fall down when having a seat :)
Do you think you could do this in unity 5?
rachristman, dopepope and David Fernandez Barruz Thank you guys.

Tresdedos, I am glad that it looks so real in VR :) I should try that.


pixelissue I am not familiar with unity 5.
You have a candle clipping pretty far into that window, Fix that, and I will call it perfect!
Great work i am new in this software by the way Tarek how u made 360 degree view in 3d max on in other software?
Fantastic scene ... congrats  !! .. Staff Pick well deserved :-)
Beaut
good
Wow, this is amazing!!! Did you create all of this from software? Or you actually took pictures in the real room? Are Cam 01, 02, 03 and 04 where you took 360 degree pictures? I saw your tutorial on this but was not clear on the beginning part about modeling. Thanks!
Great piece bro ...
@nontraditional im pretty sure that's modelled, not just scanned :)

I'd say this is the most useful anatomy model
@Reoxur 
I fully agree! Was just about to make the same comment. I've been struggling with Anatomy for years. And this has been a unbelievable help in my recent work.
I bought your model pack from your gumroad, but there's no .mtl file for the musclesnames one, just a tga file. Do I have to re-texture it myself or is there someway to make it map the way you have it here? I'm trying to open it in Cinema 4D.
Nvm, figured it out. For anyone else who's wondering:
I imported the obj. making sure to check Texture Coords (UVs) under General  and Import .MTL File under the material dropdown (even though there isn't a mtl file). This made a default white texture, which, when you load the .tga into the texture, will map to the model properly. I guess the obj file has UV maps in it without having a mtl file, so as long as you import those the tga will map properly.

Great/informative model btw!
null
Thanks guys, glad you like it! :)

Yes, you just have to import the .obj (or .stl) file with uv's and then apply the texture.

It should work like this in every 3D Program btw. :)
thats a fine educational model thanks for this one :)

Thanks Pradeep, I hope it helps. :)

Hi Chrisfischerart. I saw that you disabled the Ecorche Male model. Please do not disable this, it is helping me a lot in my anatomy study. :)
Sorry guys, the male and female models got deactivated automatically by Sketchfab (I got a free Pro Membership for three month and activated some Pro Features for testing on the male and female models .. so yesterday my Pro Membership ended and therefore those models got deactivated automatically because they still had Pro Features enabled)
Anyway, I simply reactivated the models so that you can use them again. :)
Wow, it's so clear and articulate! Gotta steal some of that brain juice
super helpful! thanks!
This one is the best here.
@chrisfischerart When will you upload the female version?

So this is how the exosuit will look like? Amazing!!
Can't wait to see this in-game.  Looks great.
Can wait to see this! I am freaking out
Awesome the are a little off on my opinion but I can't wait!
Looks amazing
if he can easily kill Leviathan all will be able to kill him in 30 seconds
mega!
alex321 there no weapons on the exosuits
I wouldn't say that.  The drill arm can be used as one.
OMG, IM NOW GOING TROUGH YOURE PROFILE, YOU STARTED THE HYPE IN ME xD
i guest
Will it come with a mp3 player?  :P
Where are the other stages for hand? I though exosuit is gonna have many special tools... i wanted to play basketball with Rock Puncher with that!
hoffe ihr konnt da noch waffen hinzufügen damit man sich gegen die monster verteidigen kann währe toll
I liked the one in the lava zone concept art better.
I hope this thing will have paintability, upgrades, and possible even dockey-ness like the seamoth.
Or maybe upgraded to have a bulkier hull and limbs.
I think the devs from subnautica has talked about the exosuit to be dockable in the cyclops like the seamoth but for paint they cant do it at the same time of the release of the exosuit drivability and new skin but for this wait till and just in case inform me im certainly not a dev but im kinda geek or some kind of gamer which play sometimes whole days
Its limbs are too skinny and its legs look too flimsy.
What would be awesome if you could upgrade it with better  guns, better armor, better legs so it runs faster and all that stuff. And what also is good idea if you want to upgrade it you need to find blueprints in specific bioms, you could find like laser gun or a jetpack blueprint!!!.
I can imagine fighting the reaper in this Pacific Rim style, shoving that drill down its throat and ending that miserable thing it calls its life. WHO'S THE BOSS NOW?!
The drill could be an upgrade like for the seamoth and it could be dockable in the moonpool like this we could set upgrades on it like his yellow version could be the basic one and the grey one could be a depth upgrade one who think that should be good?

Thanks for telling me, @seori! that's really encouraging :)
Impressive!
If I were to use this in my video game project, how should I credit you?
@vuchithien95 Thanks! I guess my name and a link to this page url would be cool! :)
Gracias por el modelo, lo he descargado y lo voy a probar en Realidad Virtual.
It is a wonderful work.
I will use it in the private MMB plan.
We will inform you when the movie is released.
Some shady shit had to have happened here. Nice job!
@Emhar 
No one can imagine ;) Thanks!

Make a .FBX File download please!
Could I use this for a video game you can get credit for the structure.

Hi BitGem, possible to download your model?
Thanks guys! This one is not for download but the figurine can be 3d printed on shapeways.com . Just search for bitgem there.

@bitgem Hey dude, I just wanted to say that I love your work and especially this model, those pose is great. I was wondering if there is any way at all could use the model for a daily render on my instagram. Everything I post on there is not for profit in any way. I really just want to attempt surfacing this amazing model :)  (@the_inky on instagram)
@theinky Hey thank you for your kind words! Just drop me a line via support@bitgem3d.com and we'll pick up the conversation from there. ;)
thanks you very much

Great work, feels very allods online like. Great texture work. Left wing has some problems with attachment but still impressive.

Great work. :)
Hey, I started a forum thread collecting 'Evil Angel' figures on Sketchfab featuring this work! Feel free to add more :)

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/evil-angels-on-sketchfab/717
do you use any figure creation tools or do you model the human form from scratch?
Model was built from scratch.
You're a true artist!
Very good!
Very Food I like it!
Holy! Lord...
Wonderful work! She's beautiful, and the texture is just so easy on the eyes. Did you do all the modeling in Maya/3DS? or sculpt a bit too?
Amazing
Hi, I am wondering I am looking for 3ds modelers for my story? I am looking for a few things like couple of ships and new alien races.

Is there away to contact artists?
I bought this model and I was wondering does this not have any controllers set up? I am trying to animate and all I see are joints.
@jessyux3 Hi Jessy, the HIK skeleton is the Maya Human IK skeleton. In Maya just open the Human IK tab and under Source select control rig and use it to key your animations. If you run into problems let us know. support@bitgem3d.com
thanks you

Very Interesting ! I just watched Richard Dawkins talk about the evolution of the eye :)
@dr.west That sounds interesting...
I see what you did here :p
Great model! Deserves a staff pick.
@mauricesvay Thumbs up!
great
Fantastic!
Holy crap, this makes my human eye model look like Atari graphics O_O

How did you create the textures? Was this all modeled by hand?
Amazing.... tell me how you did it?
Really beautiful! Great Work!
Great work!!!
Great work. The only criticism that could be brought is the tortional  movements of the eye, ind?ced by inferior and superior oblique muscles are lacking. Did you use 3dmax? Where can we find it for further development in possible mathematical calculations of strabismus surgery?
@erencerman This animation was created for fun to post on Sketchfab and not necessarily to be scientifically accurate. We used Maya for this animation. 

We used this same model for our training application available on Google Play. Its called The Physiology of the Eye. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Intervoke.ThePhysiologyOfTheEye .

This model is not for sale, go to Intervoke.com, post a comment and let me know what your looking for and we will get back to you. We can quickly create what ever you need.

Thanks for your interest!
This is very cool. I have been having a hard time finding good references for how an eyeball sits in the skull and this is one of the few. Great work!
Thanks for sharing! very useful model
wwwooooww!! haha this is insane!! Congratulations
Fantastic model - will be very useful for our students to see how the eye is moved :)
Hmm.. What with this long, empty space behind the eye? This model is created with distortions (to better show the muscles), or in reality this place looks like this?
If this model is correct, then how is this space filled? Fat?
Really great!
astonishing !!
Version 2.0 has internal geometry now. It works really well too... Check out the retina and cilliary bodies.
WOW

@caguzma Thank you very much!
@hugocolauto I'm very grateful
@gulupao thanks!
@nehon Thank you very much!
I wish I could buy this cuz it’s so beautiful man, really loved it, I have an amazing idea for a video for a song I’m soon going to release, and I’ve been finding a samurai 3D model ...this is just perfect, but I noticed it isn’t downloadable/purchasable ;(((( ..really awesome though!!
I just started reading Vagabond a few days ago, and then came across your model. Very serendiputous. This is by far the best rendition I have seen of Musashi. His face, the hair, the line art texturing and the overall mood are excellent. They match the character perfectly, well done!
@Samcreed?Thank you.  I’d like to make sure it is possible to sell 3D fan art.
@JustinGriffis?I’ll be happy if you physically experience Musashi’s attitude to pursue strength through my work.  Vagabond’s psychological depiction is wonderful and the pictures are beautiful.
Oh wow! This is great! I love how you managed to capture Inoue's unique style in 3d form, an increbly impressive feat for any artist. Look's authentic from every angle!
Also the pose is sublime! Somehow you managed to capture Musashi's rigid yet free flowing movement in a single pose, which just blows my mind.
Such a great piece of work! Beautifully hand painted <3
@seafoam Thank you very much.   By imaging Musashi's movement many times, I chose the best posture just like the camera captures the moment.
@alicedruzga Thank you!
@jobog man I appreciate it! Well if it’s possible for how much will you sell it for, cuz I’ll have some idea how much I gotta save up for that! Yeh I’m just 16 man, also I don’t want to request money from my parents, I do some artistic work like this and earn few bucks to buy and upgrade stuff, I really want to this model, and yes I’ll definitely credit u once the video is out !
@Samcreed?I found that the Copyright Law does not allow download or selling of this kind of work, and I’m starting to produce the next work.  Thank you for your interest in my work.
Well done. That's a staff pick!
well done. This must have taken months for all the detail. quick add to my fav
I like this vvvvvvvvvvvvvery much!

Ooh so good! One for the Nintendo Fan Art thread? :)

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/share-your-nintendo-fan-art-here/31
Oh my God so good
Can I turn you into my new God?
@nachozl Please do :D
what program do you use when you make these characters?
@Shokie1990  Mostly Maya. 3Dcoat and Zbrush when needed.
You were featured on IT'S ART Magazine!

Woot ! It' s an honor !
Awesome work!
You're featured on CG Channel!

http://www.cgchannel.com/2015/02/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-february-2015/
This is epic, just read the sketchfab blog post on how you did it!! Can't wait to try this method
Awsome render !
Hey, I enjoyed reading your Art Spotlight, 'making-of' post :) I think the model looks awesome, and you did a great job on the pose :)  I still have some questions.. Did you pose your model before adding the skirt and applying the NCloth Simulation, or did you pose it afterwards ? Im not so familiar with NCloth and the workflow that comes with it when creating clothing for characters, but since I use maya for modelling, its probably a good idea to learn it at some point :D

And for the Light baking.. did you bake everything inside Maya, after applying a two tone shading material? 

Thanks in advance :)
Hey Funnycom, thanks for your kind words.
For the ncloth simulation I made 2 keyframe for the character, the rest pose (T pose) and the final one, separated by something like 30 frames. Then once I start the simulation, the character and cloth, both in rest pose, transition into the final pose while being affected by the various fields. 

If you like clothing may I suggest Marvelous Designer ? I didn't try it yet but it look really powerfull and simple.

As for the light baking, yes I bake color+lightning into maya.
I love her :-)

Can you make a model of Tiki from Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon?

Hi, I'm very interested in trying to 3d print this out!  Would you be willing to post the model for download?

If not, no worries, I understand :)

how much longer till u release all the models
Amazing Indeed :3
Great job!
Amazing! I can see why the body took long to upload as always keep up the good work!
Mangle just flipped me the bird.
THIS IS AMAZING

i always imagined that extra head as the mangle's pet parrot or something :P
Where is the 3rd eye?
I would guess he would put the eye in the bodygroups tab in gmod.
what does commissioning mean?
@sandvich It means that someone (most likely Keithy) is paying I6NIS money to create the models.
So what do you think on the Mangle = Glados theory?
makes sense.
i have just realized that the hands are the wrong way round.
The proof is that you can make the pose of Mangle's artwork with this model but you need the hands the other way round.
Take a look: http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141111234109/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/c/c5/RedesignedFoxyTheMangle.png
if you can make old foxy
I have no words how cool it
link download please
Please make old foxy
nice
Do you have an estimated time of when these models will be public?
@octupie Gotcha, thanks
Can you make old Bonnie?
Cool just need to point one thing out sorry mangle has one exoskeleton foot and the rest is fine plus she has pink nail polish
Now this, I like.

epic silhouetting skills here man. love this style :D
sooo cool, awesome work man love the limited use of colours.
What a wonderfully stylized scene! How did you achieve the orthogonal view though??
Awesome 3D style ! It reminds me of the game Another world. Well done.

@bart, you can get an isometric view by using a very low value for the Camera field of view setting.
@Veyratom thanks that's a great trick, I'll have to remember that.
Very impressive scene.
Awesome scene!. 
This is beautiful! 
Great ! Excellent Work !
Wow! Amazing work man! What software do you use buddy?
so cool
Excellently!

Wow... Just amazing.
OMG dude this looks so awesome. Really nice job.

Such a nice use of the 3D viewer! <3
Despite the limited camera motion the parallax effect works really nice.
@essimoon Don´t want to get my dirty tricks revealed hehehe, Thank you !!
This is really lovely, the illusion is so well played that even when rotating and noticing it's a very well made 3D model makes me smile. Awesome stuff juan!
@ricardoman13 Thanks for those kind words Ricardo, truly ^^
Awesome! Staff pick :)
wow! The textures and the 3d model are really well made. From every angle I can rotate from, it looks like a  polished watercolor painting.
@james Thank you so much James!!!! :DD
@jx Ohhh so glad you think that, that was my intention ^^ Thanks.

Another excellent character!! Beautiful!
What's tool you use for paint the texture? I use Bodypaint, but is a little crap.
Thanks Norick_DJ!
I use 3d coat + PS.
Thanks I will try it :)
Amazing works. Do you use higher poly model to do the details or do you simply hand paint everything ?
Thank you Yann!
For this one - high poly sculpt - bake - painting texture. Here is a WIP thread if you are interested http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=145350

thank you for the compliments! Makes all the hard work worth it :)
You can still find them on Ebay or on local flea markets if you're lucky. I managed to buy a G&W for €1 a while ago :)
Oh, and I imagine you're seen this online version?

Thanks! I hadnt seen that. Its a lot harder to play with a mouse than your two hands. Great fun.
You can use the cursor keys :)
thanks .. thats better!
One of my favorite games back!

This feels like surrealist gaming. Love it!

A great example of 3d modeling aiding with documentation, rescue, etc. I wonder if this model could be admitted as evidence for legal purposes? At the very least, unlike flat 2d photos, it would give viewers a spatial view that would speak so much about the destruction.
Verry interesting! Marco Boulogne, dutch urban search and rescue team. Www.usar.nl.

Wanted to let you know that 80lvl featured this back in their February's Sketchfab Picks! Congrats! 

https://80.lv/articles/sketchfab-picks-february-edition/
So awesome man! Is this the actual in game model?
@SamKircher Yes, exactly the same.
null
@karolmiklas Awesome! I am a Mechanical designer and I want to design up a real manufacturable replica of this, and possibly make one, or give the plans to someone who will make one. Is there any chance I could get a dummy model to use for scale etc?
@SamKircher Hey, I would suggest contacting Bluehole (developer of the game), as they are the owner of the model. :)
null
Holy Shit!
Im verry verry like this model :( can u share me ????
is there any way i can get myself a player model. i have a video idea and it would be awesome to make. thanks alot.
How do I download it? Can I? Im new to sketchfab.
How did you get it?
@glasa.sk I made it. This one's official :)
I love this vehicle amazing work... Im going to try and make a replica in 3ds Max... :)
@RevisedPlayer8 Oh cool, I'm flattered :) let me know how it goes!
You created it in a blender3d?
@Z_Kir Yeah, in Blender. Textured in Substance Painter

@rawrsoft Hmm i don't think so. I spended a looot of hours for this model (it's my first sculpt) and i want to do new things :) Thanks for comment, i'm glad you like it!
Letting you know that we loved this so much we featured it on our social media! Hope this brought more viewers to your work!
Thats really an original idea whigh I find so fine. Love the bubblegum in the heros mouth.

Good work.

That is just incredible  O.O

I love it ! I'd like to ask if i could download it ? I want to 3d print it for my figurine collection :)
Thanks everyone for the 100 likes! You make me so happy :) I'm working on a model of 2B from Nier automata. I will upload it the next week! Stay tuned!
How can you print it if their are floating parts?
love it
@wadowado wt this comment said
I really like it, but the eyes need work. The edges are hard and the texture map is blurry. Everything else though is well done!
Wait, is this legal to sell? I mean it's blizzard character.
@somacruz2 Is not illegal (and also it's pretty common) to sell fanart. Actually, there are tons of copyrighted characters on the skecthfab store :)

This model is not perfect, it was one of my first sculpts, but there is a lot of people asking for it. That's why i'm selling it.
@chami.desu Ok, thanks for explaining :)
@somacruz2 No prob mate!
null
@chami.desu Well selling Fanart is not legal in US. And thats the country where Blizzard is located. Sooo....
@chami.desu hi mate, is this 3D file can use for 3D Printing ? I want to make this 3D fig :D thanks !

Something very wrong with the sound on Safari but works great on firefox.
Nice
Amazing animation work! Works like this help pushing the idea that 3D is an amazing platform for storytelling :)
Agh! why would you restrict the camera so much? 
If one cannot even move the image at all then why have it on sketchfab? Might as well be just a mp4 file.
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know you can move around by going into the model inspector mode. I love seeing these wonderful works in closer detail.
It's actually unbelievable for me how much texturing does! 
Insanely low-poly models, still looks so real! Love it!
woah this is amazing! can you... double-staff pick something? :D
If so, this scene would deserve it!
This is truly a masterpiece, I love it! It's so inspiring in many ways, I can't stop looking at it :)

Thank you, Bart!
Yes, i have used the 3ds max morpher.
It is a GREAT new feature! i was waiting for this moment. hehehe
Wow, amazing! I made a jsfiddle with sound :) https://jsfiddle.net/g21v3zgd/19/embedded/result/
Ohhh fresh heart!
Wow!!
that is amazing Alban, very good with the sound, looks much more realistic, haha
I didn't know that we can make the models with a soundtrack.
very good, very good. =)
Seems like my heart is beating with the rhythm of this model
It would be great if annotations were put on this.
Agreed, but our animation system doesn't support annotations yet..
That's awesome. Is that morph target anim?
Thank you JCulley3D, yes it is morpher targets. =)
Well it's an excellent example of it.  Good work.
Cool stuff!
Though as I'm sure you noticed... you have a small intersecting polygon issue during part of the animation where the inner side of the tube stick through to the outside for a frame or two. Probably just need to adjust the weight painting slightly in that area (if using a rig). Or just adjust the model so the wall thickness is greater in that area so there is more play before the polygons intersect.
I'm a student. I need this drawing for my project. Would you give me a download link?
how may you be contacted, we want to discuss a sort of cooperation. 
we need to buy this module how to??
@khayalstudio Hello, khalstudio, contact me please.

Hi Michel, I'm interested in buying your model for a small music video project. Please, contact me asap if interested.
Hi, the fbx file has embedded all the textures into a single file ?
Thanks
@jaluzon hi jaluzon.
Yes, the texture file is a single image for each channel of the texture (1 image for difuse, 1 image for normal).
You also can download other file formats such as .blend
Let me know if you have any other inquires.  ;)
Hi, is the fbx has the animation curves, or are baked?
@davomora Hi, you can access the animation curves with the blend file.

I am applying for becoming seller now.
So, please wait a few days.
@JunZhiSanZhai I'll make a purchase when I get money.

I would love to purchase this model to study as well!
If it's for sale I'll buy it as soon as possible.. I want to study how you made your model :)
@betaflight Sorry... I could not become a seller because number of models produced is too small.
@mykelartic Sorry...
This is a really well executed model. I'm very interested in how you made this model. I think it would be even better if you rigged this in the future and then animated it.
@strombringer744 Thank you so much!
This model is already rigged and animated and danced.

@JunZhiSanZhai I just watched it and i love the song choice! Good job. Very well done!
This model is extremely awesome! I love how close it looks to the original 2D artwork of Prinz, and the rigged version of the model in the dance vid is also greatly executed! 

Will you be willing to let the model be used in games such as VRChat? If so, I’d love to buy a copy of it to use in VRChat if you’d like to sell it (it would be a personal skin, not public). If sketchfab doesn’t let you become a seller (I saw a previous comment on this but for a different purpose), I can ask my friend who is a 3D renderer himself if he knows of any other places where you could do so. Or, if you want to make this model public for people to use in the game, I know that the VRChat website allows you to upload your models to the site itself (i think it requires you to play the game a bit tho if you don’t do so already).

Thanks for taking the time to read this lol, and I can’t wait to see your next models!
110% do want. will buy. really well done. :)
Stuff like this is just un believably impressive.
Perfect! Please write me your workflow! This is amazing!
Holy crab :O  Please, give a Staff picks this man >:v  Amazing model! <3

It's so nice! How long to create this beautiful model?

this looks amazing!! gotta play dark souls again! :D
amazing :D 
i love Dark souls,your model is perfect :D
Beautiful. Would be good to use the real-time shadows on it.
Shadow are on, but not following camera. You can move the light with the ALT key. ;)
And I just noticed that you probably already knew that.
Great work, you're featured in our video of the day on Facebook! :) https://www.facebook.com/Sketchfab/videos/947418785320779/
Thanks! :)
This is so cool! How do I get the textures? The zip only contains the mesh.
Awesome work dude :) Just started playing with Blender. I hope that I'll be able to do something like that in the future ! :)
whoah...
Where can we get the textures?
What about the textures? Or do we have to create our own for this one?
What about the textures mate? Where can I get them?
hi guys its very good and thanks .

but i have a question ...
is this character have a texture ?
if it have ; please share your link for download the texture in here i need this special thanks .
Link to download the textures in description.

(I couldn't figure out how to allow texture download here without re-uploading everything)

Enjoy.
Cool work !
great your work ... keep on trying
Awesome!!!
Super guapo!!
Great Work!
I can't thank you enough for this model! It is helping me in making an Artorias costume. Keep up the amazing work!
@bits Awesome! Let us see when it´s finished.

gorgeous
What software do you use to do the retopology ? And how long does it takes you ? It's really impressive
@Kokusho I used topogun. This work was really long for me because I did it in parallel with my work and other fanarts. I've started it nearly 2 month ago. If I'd worked only with this work it had to be 1.5-2 weeks or so
@rybak ^__________^
So....why?  (I couldn't resist) ;)
LOVE the details! :)
@rocketeer neurosis :D
@iggy-design thanks <3
This is a really cool study! Love the details.
So amazing! Really nice concept and modeling!
Really beautiful !
its so perfect its amazing the extreme fidelity with the concept
Wow amazing work! It has an interesting mix of 'cartoon' and 'realistic' styles. Yes, it definitely gets my staff pick :)
Sublime! Simply a perfect work. :)
Damn mate. You're in my top 3 of the best modelers on Sketchfab hands down. This model is stunning. Hope they're gonna find a way to make talent transfers soon with D-Wave Quantic Computers. I want what you have ! :)
@hansolocambo haha thanks) I think AI\neural networks soon should do the same ) You'll have as much thoughtless-jun as you'll wish
@chami.desu ^_^
good work :)
Amazing work !  I'm not sure that this kind of armor could protect her but she's sexy ! :)
Love the amount of good detail  zoom in to the sword it dose not fall apart on high zoom
Hey, I'm designing an rpg style game similar to Dark souls in a way, but I'm lacking good 3d model. Your models are amazing, I've been going through them and some are just perfect for the theme of my game. Would you be interested in joining my development team for creating this game?
@codethepath Sounds interesting =) Can you tell me more about your project? (mail lera.nilova@gmail.com or skype lera.nilova)
good work?this is my first comment  test-???
The face is a pretty drastic departure stylistically, and the eyes are dished inwards an insane amount, but these are minor quibbles in an expertly built model. Bravo!
@jvaughan you're absolutely right =) I even fixed it up on my artstation but didn't fixed it here yet ) Thanks!

It shows!  The rigging, skinning, and animation work on the wings is incredible.  You nail the texture everywhere, -excellent detailed, original, texture that is... AWESOME!     Secondary action, tail action, mouth skinning, inner mouth touch, -luv it :) !      Did you hide the layer that has the burnt up elf body inside of the dragon on export?  :D    Not to forget, it is super COOL that you can stop the animation, zoom in, and check out all of the great detail ( w00t Sketchfab :) ! )
Hey awesome model! I love the animation too! Beautiful work!
I'm going to be making my own Wyvern/Dragon soon. Would you please be able to share how you unwrapped it and your textures please? I would love some reference! thanks a ton!

Hey is this available for download? I am an indie game dev who would be more than interested in using this in a horror game
You should add some basic animations (idle, attack, die) and then sell this. I want to buy it.

@tristonxu i dun't really understand what you mean :)
@kody3d I mean the it can be printed by 3d printer?
@tristonxu i don't know, maybe. I never worked with 3d printers before. Still it will not look as cool as it looks here - cos here there is no light on a model, in reality - there is one.

@Michael Calvert one evening, around that, as for software - does it matter for such model? ~250 tris, yet if you really want to know - maya + PS :D

@NomadKing Thanks man! Do it :D It will be fun and challenging XD

Congratulations PaulsRage! You won first place in the Static category in our Lights, Camera, Immersion Contest!

https://blog.sketchfab.com/lights-camera-immersion-contest-winners/

I got in touch for your prizes!
@seori Wow! Thank you very much! I'm so happy :) 
And once again thank you all!
Pretty Awesome and a Don Bluth fan as well, there is a great Animation book he came out with Don Bluth's Art Of Animation Drawing - https://www.amazon.com/Don-Bluths-Art-Animation-Drawing/dp/1595820086
Love the film and love this re-creation! Fantastic work! Definitely worthy of 1st place! :)
Amazingly done scene, congrats! :D
This is completely incredible. I love it. It's even better because it really brings the viewer right into the scene in a unique way, and you can really experience how fearsome it is. I last saw this film as a little girl in the 80s, and it scared me so much I never saw it again. This really brought back a lot of memories, the incredible creepiness of the film, and it is just the best to get that perspective from inside the scene. 

I could not possibly be more impressed with this. The time, care and skill is obvious. Just amazing work.
AmAzing, you totally nailed the mood and the characters !
WOW! Amazing work! I just love everything!

The texture work is beyond incredible! Congrats on the 1st place! :D
Awesome, really superb, well done!!!
Wow. Big fan of the movie. Wanted to do a similar thing for a while! Not going to because this is awesome!
outstanding work

This is incredible work.  Fantastic job man.

@Colorfan I simply made it in 3dsmax with box modeling technique.. pulling vertexes in space until they form a feet :D I textured it in 3d-coat and photoshop, jumping between the two softwares constantyl
@paulchambers3d Thanks for the pick!
@alban thanks! It was painted with a tablet.. I guess quill would have been an effective choice aswell :D
@Johnkuendo thanks!

@joshpurple : thanks! re uploaded it, with some little fix / tweaking in the wings area, tweaked the albedo as well and added an emissive map. glad you like it. still need to fix all the animations.
Amazing job!! Profactor, beautiful dragon lov it!!
I love this. It gets my staff pick
Awesome dragon! I like the way it looks kinda young
@Jakob Baldwin : thanks! :) That's true he looks kind of young.
@Bart: thanks a lot for the staff pick! :)
@malbers.shark87: thank you, glad you love it.
06/03/2016: added 30 seconds of animations, about 30 seconds left to go... Half way there. Polished skinning.
Great update :) !  Looks outstanding!
@joshpurple: thanks, next final update in maybe two days! :)
Finally updated the mountain dragon with his complete animation set (41 animations). hope you guys will like it.
41 animations :) !   And they all look great!  Excellent job, & I'm blown away by how well you have all the textures/UV mapping/Skinning/Rigging done!   

Congrats!
He's burping right :D ?   

(JK!  But I'd enjoy hearing the burping in-game.   <--since I'm chowder head :)  ).

Again, great work!
We recommended your work to IAMAG.CO and they featured it:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-67/

Congrats :)
this is..... AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC XD
How did you animate this? 
I'm guessing with Maya?
i love your dragon. the animations are incredible. what´s the game called?
Oh?My God??  Very beautiful
WOAH!!! what program did you use to make this :O
I liked all the animations except for the wing flap flying anim. It looks too rigid and choppy.
What I mean is there's not a lot of follow through on the wing.
Love it!

Thank you @formanosque, however I can only take small amount of the credit.  The models and volume renders were used by us to understand the size and complexity.  For her surgeons, it was a tool they could use to discuss the surgery with interns and the surgical team.  They were not used in surgery.  My hope was to hopefully offer something new to the table and I succeeded.  However, as Dr. Garner had said to me, the resolution of the scanning process (and tangible models) just are not there yet for their type of surgical procedure. However he does see this as a great tool for discussion and training.

This is a great way to explain to people the value of DICOM scan analysis at home with InVesalius!
Would you be interested in connecting for a brief interview about this?  It would be great to share this via @3DQWERTY (twitter) or @3DGEOM on www.3dqwerty.com!   You can send me a DM there or connect via Twitter.  You can contact me 3dgeom@gmail.com and I can send some more information !  Interviews are generally from 30 - 45 minutes
Love it!
I hope it won't bother you. I'm a postgraduate student from china, we are doing some research on 3D mesh to assessment the quality of the models based on based on 3D mesh. Now we urgently need some models of high definition. If you can share your high definition models with us. We would be grateful.
@gdp Please contact me at mebalzer@slo3dcreators.com  Thanks
we also create stuff like this
I do remember step-building this prototype.
@james214  Curious on what you mean by step-building  this prototype? This isn't a prototype, and as mentioned in the description, this was derived from the CT scan DICOM images using 3D Slicer.  I have cleaned this model up as you can see in our TEDx talk and several images of my wife posing with that 3D printed skull for Make Media, AP, and several online media journals.
@mebalzer Sorry for the misunderstanding.
@james214 I don't know if there is any misunderstanding, just wondering what step-building this prototype means.  I know this model is floating out there in Chinese medical schools and Ultimaker has this exact same model that they used to create skull to put on display in their trade-show exhibit, so it is quite possible you did have access to it, I am just curious on the term step-building.  I have also made the model downloadable now, so others may print it or use it for anatomy study.  The procedure for doing this resection by performed by Dr. Paul Gardner at UPMC of the top orbital roof was quite amazing.

@mattogreen25 Ok do you have an email account i can contact you with?
Really like the Warper it has a(n) long body like the reaper.Will it grow? Is it in the blood kelp biome or in the jelly shrome caves?
The Fox3D team only make the models, Gcoop.  They don't place them in the game.
Oh I'm sorry i did not know...
I still think this is the most visually impressive thing in Subnautica.
Love the face looks like a mole.
I can't wait till they add this in the game!
Interesting transparent organs...
I would love to see the Spec color maps for these creatures. They all have amazing florescent light interactions on the membranes.

https://www.artstation.com/artwork/0X8GW8 -- Used your model in a 3d environment piece I made-- I gave you credit-- thanks a lot for this awesome model!
I am downloading. are you a student or teacher or both?  I will print.  I have a 3D image of my own head/skull for dental replacement.  Can you give any suggestions on how to take that to a 3D print?  I don't know the extension of the CTs/ final image I got.  But it is my and my mouth, I would like to try different teeth to see how it looks.  Maybe a good business for you.  People do want images of themselves.
?????? ??????? ?????? ????????!
Thanks for the model! It was a great help to my project.  I am just learning how model and it was a fantastic guide.
Awesome work!!!
Very useful not only for school children, but also for anatomy classes (at least for dental school ??)
????????
thx
Nice model. Was expecting that also inner surfaces would be there if this is from medical point of view. Anyway great work!
nice model, I took this model and morphed it into a Neanderthal skull in blender, when i upload it to sketchfab (if that is ok) ill credit your model and have a link to your model

Cool!! You can build a big city with this =)
awesome work as always my friend.... very inspiring!
great job! love it!
Hi guys, I was wondering if you could add the obj format of all the individual elements please :) It's kinda hard to convert everything at once, I keep on getting errors everywhere...
@Pholothe1 Will the .fbx files not work? May I ask what you need .obj files for? Perhaps there is a workaround.
@bitgem I have had trouble batch converting all the files in .obj or .dae, the thing is that I am trying to use the assets in Godot Engine but I can't use the .fbx directly :/
nice model ill try do remake it for my demo real but there are some ngones and triangles! maybe check it out!
hole.io )
XD
@Pholothe1 you can try to export to GLTF, it should work on Godot 3.x.
I think there's a way to do that with the new blender 2.80 beta
@toshiwo Okay! Thank you for the response :)
Super cool!
It's cool, but would be AWESOME if it was free.
Cool. Shame you need basic human needs (like everyone else)
fasinating

clouds is sooo powerful :)
These clouds outmaster 75% of models here. Hats off! Any tips how did you do it? :D
Thx y'all! I really appreciate all the comments! 
@karolmiklas Of course :-) The idea came from Damian Nenow who explained at Siggraph ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ1J9Af01PYà ) how he managed to make the clouds for his animated movie 'paths of hate' : http://www.platigeshorts.com/paths-of-hate.html
But he made it in 3ds Max, so I translated the idea into Cinema 4D.
Sensational work on the clouds - they create such a perfect atmosphere!
Mind = Blown
Damn those clouds are freaking amazing and all that in 41k poly .. totally have to figure out how you did that now. Great work
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

This is a beautiful piece of work. The only complaint I would have is that your seams are visible in several areas of the model most significantly along the sides of the abdomen where the lightness of the color makes if very noticable.
woow, can i get the obj for my own collection, is incredible dude
This looks so awesome and cool! :)
How long did this take to model?
Great render and pose
Great! How is that my faces are so odd and this one is so good.
This girl for the Riot Art contest have one of the cutest face I've seen on a 3D model. Excellent work !

Great model!
Hey I am a volunteer forum moderator over at Oculus.com ... I have included a link to your model there as we are having a small community competition to design a VR related Desktop Wallpaper. I linked to your model to get people up and running quickly. Thanks again.

Good
beautiful
The model is nice! 

But it does not seem to have the correct measurements with the Oculus rift CV1 that I got delivered this week. Don't understand why Oculus can't share there 3D model of there device. Now everyone that needs measurements needs to do a 3D scan.
Thnks a lot!
*me watching this in VR view through an Oculus Rift*
someone: what are you watching?
me: an Oculus Rift.
someone: yea, but what are you watching with the Oculus?
me: an Oculus...
Thanks for the model!
Nicely Done
Really awsome work man!
awesome!

Amazing work bro!
@Black_Dragon you're welcome , enjoy ;)
@desu4ever thaanks , enjoy ;)
I can't convert this file to stl... don't know why D:
I converted it but it had many problems when i printed it :/ dont know why @Necro48
how can i convert it to stl?
Hmm i used blender for converting to stl , but i also must say i got a problem with the printing if you had that try to solve it before printing @majk0248
thx for advise :)
Nice work!, I have a question, I'm completely new to 3D printing and so, I've read that it should be converted to STL or something and i have no idea what that is, But when i downloaded your model it ends in FBX , Shall i just go to a 3D Printshop and they'll automatically print it? or i'll run into problems and won't be able to?
null
@MohanNad.Hossam  yes one of the printable formats is STL and no you should use 3d application like blender to export it as STL (fbx -> stl) and then take it to printshop to print it (or i dunno they may can export the fbx to the format of their printer , just ask them first it depends on the way you want it to be printed and the printer ) :D

but i must say that when i used it with this model i got into trouble , make sure if you made it into stl ask them for a proper print version :D
I did exactly as you said but they replied to me that the model had a problem once i converted it to stl, it had a huge gap in her stomach area, and when i made a makeprint fix for it, the model's quality went way too low than expected, May you please send me your fix, maybe it's quality is better, thus i'll be able to print it, because i'm totally new to this, and i'm fascinated by Nier Automata and 2B, that's why i want her as a figurine :D
@MohanNad.Hossam i had the same problem too i still couldnt fix it , if i did i will notify you , i really like her too
Awesome model! Thanks for sharing!
Good work!. Thanks for sharing
Why when you open through 3Ds max the chaos turns out? Or am I doing something wrong?
What do u mean by chaos? I used Maya for the model @beetleking67060
awesome dude shes Beautiful. Love 2B

Nice to meet you. I will use your wonderful model for my creation. Thank you.

I downloaded it. Since the center is slightly misaligned in the model, correct it with Blennder so that it works properly.

How do I put this in unity with textures?
@SleepingEon Import the source and the texture in the asset folder. Drag and drop the texture to the inspector of the source.
You should select the materials one by one for the sources with multiple textures.
Im putting this in my game. U have a spot in the credits :)
Good! Thanks! How to create?
I was looking for a longtime  a 3D file.I got my hope again for you..I'm really greatful to you.    It was awesom.
uno de los modelos mas realistas que he visto se ve genial
Love this car can't seem to find the texture for it tho
esta super genial

Top work, I thought this was photogrammetry on first look. Off to look at your other work,......
this is gorgeous- thanks for sharing!
I love this style!
Hello. I love this. How did you make the wall transparent on one side and then textured on the other? Is there a setting that I have missed on the 3D settings? It just opens up the room at different position. Love it.
@kokjhoonwong 
You can turn double-sided or one-sided polygons view in settings and model will be visible on one side (you have to define normals) or two.
Indeed. Thanks for that. Now it makes sense. I will try it next time.
Congrats man! Very good ^^
Just explored it in VR with a Vive, amazing! I could hang out there all day, congrats @liam.broughm
in its being dirty, this house is beautiful!
but I would not want to live there
Awesomeee!
I enjoyed my visit in VR :D
Great Job!  Love the realism.

Nice job!  Very well optimized.  It is a smart and beautiful model.  I am especially impressed by the fact that it is all self-lit.
@FilipAAOfficial 
Sorry mate, no can do.
This was made for a client. It’s here for demo purposes only. I don’t have distribution rights.
Great model, but you should add some annotations to make it easier to navigate!
you used c4d for modelling? and maya for baking textures?

insane ! and just one 1024 texture.. damn !
@hansolocambo thanks man! yeah cramming all the textures into 1 1024x1024 was a real challenge. i used this trick where everything was mirrored except for the front torso area. also making the textures in blender instead of photoshop made it easier to change UVs and repaint a lot easier. :)

The body's probably very different from the original model of the game too. So is the hair.

It's hard to get the right proportions from random images of the game, hehe. :D

@Ivanix88 

Thank you Ivanix! 

It's not as accurate as a proper toon shader (celshading) based on lighting, but it was the closest I could get in Sketchfab! :)
I've featured your work on BlenderNation, enjoy :-)

https://www.blendernation.com/2017/02/27/favourite-blender-art-sketchfab-2017-week-9/
I just sow the game and it looks just like it, the pose looks like it to
@bartv 

Thank you, Bart! ^^
@Creeperkiller 

Thank you Creepkiller! 

I really tried to capture Link's proportions, textures, colors and the in-game toon shader look. 

The head, hair and some body proportions are actually pretty different from the game, but I'm glad you think it looks close enough! :)

Thank you!
Well done! How did you made the shader in sketchfab? considering the shadow part have right colors
@lucak 

Hi Lucak, thank you! :)

I faked the toon shader by creating a black and white Environment Map and then set the materials to completely reflect it. 

In order to keep the shadows colored I used an Emission texture with the exact color the shadows should be, so every material in the model uses an Albedo and an Emission map. 

Here's an example of the setup: http://i.imgur.com/861GlpX.png

Hope it helps! :D
I always enjoy Link and Zelda.  Thank you.
Wow, that shading is amazing! :O Great to see how much stylized lighting is possible with Sketchfab!
This is fantastic! Would love to see a tutorial on how you set up the lighting and BOTW look! 10/10!

Nice model ....I want to know how you did the texturing part like toon style, Is there any way i can create this type of character in maya and  making anime character face is similar to making a human face you know like understanding the anatomy of face is it necessary in anime face model
Oh wow this if fantastic! I'm giving it a staff pick.
Her back is abit uninspired, unlike your front. maybe a strap or some trim of sorts to give it a bit more life. I know these are 3D models however that also means all of the sides need to be some what interesting. Other than that its very cute.
Could you add the #blender tag so I can find this model for my weekly post on BlenderNation? Thanks :)

Awesome, I was checking out your game yesterday, congratz for the staffpick :)
Whoa! Thats cool.

Impressive! 
How do you place the logo SUBNAUTICA static in the background?
@eliut he's using a custom background, which are available to users with a pro account!
Thank you, everybody! :)
Pfff, I didn't want to sleep anyway.
This is so cool! I'm so excited to see this in the game! :D I've been waiting for something crawly like this... =w=
It will be awhile before this magnificent creation is in the game since the team is low on programmers right now for creature A.I.  That is why the Crabsnake, Rock Puncher, Shocker Eel and Sea Treader are not in the game yet.
At first I thought that this thing was terrifying, but now I think it isn't that terrifying after all.
nice, how deep down does this monstrosity live?
it looks like it walks on land
Doubt it.  Legs are too thin.  With a head that size, it would need to be permanently in the water to floating.  Probably can run on the ocean floor though.

I disagree. The missing part of the model just add to the mystery.
I am working on a videoclip for my artacademie... do you think there would be a possibility for me to use this lady?
I think she is great
bad... Where is the Boobs?
cool! Even the goose bumps!
Oh man, thats very cool. Its so unsettling when you turn the model around.

Thank you!
Great work Dmitry! I was curious: have you ever tried to add just a tiny bit of 'Sharpness'? It can really bring out your textures. Here's an example:

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/quick-tip-improve-your-3d-scan-with-the-sharpness-camera-effect/696
Thanks for a tip Bart! It was very late when i was posting it and hit some problems with alpha that i reported in support. Just forgot about sharpness >__<
Cool! :)

How i can download this?
shes thicc
what was the name of the model in Umodel?
@Spook50622505 You can't download Fortnite skins, that would be illegal distribution.
@mrrik through datamining fortnite
@starbucksmonkey You know that it is basically stealing right?
@mrrik i guess it is, but if you use it for personal use, than it should be fine. If you just want to 3d print a model of a character that that should be fine, but, if you were to sell the model, then you would get into legal issues. I can't guarantee anything though.
Unless you have permission from Epic Games (Which I would persume you don't) You aren't allowed to share these. Be it for personal or commercial use. Sorry to tell you but in the worst case you could be sued by them. Just warning you.
@mrrik good point. I won't be sharing any skins that I datamined anyways so I should be fine.

Awesome work! I'm trying to get into Maya, but I'm struggling with texturing a character. May I ask where or how you learned your techniques?
@KingFirejet 
Monkey see, monkey do. In my case, I made a high-poly model for the sweater and shoes then bake AO by xNormal.
How do they even make these models?
is the file with the rigs included anywhere? i cant seem to find them. Awesome model btw ^^
it soo awesome
Nice
good job :)
beauty!
very cool
Cute.
will the rig also be available?
Hermoso trabajo, soy fanático al manga y al anime. Yo estoy empezando a trabajar con 3Ds Max y me gustaría hacer trabajos como el tuyo en el futuro. Te agradecería bastante que pudieras guiarme o ayudarme a conseguir tutoriales para crear personajes estilo anime en 3Ds Max. Muchas gracias de paso por permitir descargar este hermoso trabajo.
3D printed @ 200% scale which is 88mm including the stand. Pretty tough to remove using Cura's supports (broke both arms and figure off the stand). I did manage to glue everything together and attempt painting her. It's so cool that it's possible to grab a random 3D model and print it in such a tiny and un-optimized form! Thanks for making your model available for download.
Hi, I am just an enthusiast not an animator.  I am using a Kinect to play with face/body rigging but I was wondering if I could ask you to make a 3D anime model for mocap/rigging purposes; I would commission it but I am not sure what you would charge for something similar to this elf girl model

Thanks

@paulchambers3d im so sorry my bad 
thankyou next time we will carefully pick category
Nice work Adipriatna even though you say you gave up on it it still looks really impressive keep up the good work and cant wait to see your next model.
brilliant!
@Dragonite246 This model is actually not finished in the armor and still many UV errors but im so happy you like this model :D
@triptych1 thankyou ;D
Amazing ??
@shinjou thanks :D
What's with this ridiculously bad ass soundtrack? Digging the surface details too.
@arcandio sound track name : Dead Wood 
if you want to serch it :D 

thankyou :D
I have a couple of original characters that were made to order in a very stylised manner. I have since decided to redo them into a more ... well... into a LESS stylised format and then give it the substance treatment or somehow give it a proper PBR texturing.

Looking at this model that is so full of mistakes that two of you gave up on it... all I can say is Can I please send you my mascot characters and will you please make just as many mistakes on them for me? PLEASE!

I mean WOW! Your mistakes would make my characters look so awesome that I will stop everything else I am doing and start creating games with them just so I can share the experience with the world. :D

TLDR version: This model absolutely kicks some serious ass! I can quite literally say that I absolutely love every single thing about it from your choice of proportions right up to the color scheme. My hat off to you.
@myBadStudios hahahaa don't t to excessive :D 
Thank you for your appreciate :)
Awesome! I like it so much!
@adipriatna 
Hi again. Seriously, though, could you please contact me via email and tell me if you would be interested in redoing my characters for me, please? 

I am in no hurry so you can take as long as you want and I'll even give you some creative freedom so you can make them in this style. The basic character designs are there so now you can just make it look awesome and tell me how much you are gonna charge me for doing it for me. :) You can contact me on admin @ mybadstudios . com

I am very curious to hear what this would cost me. I am truly in love with this model. I wanted to upgrade my cartoony characters to something realistic but this style of yours is absolutely perfect for my taste!

Lookng forward to hearing from you
amazing work, as always.
null
@adipriatna of course I'm always amazed by your models
Tell me, what price?
Kshatriya Arm is nicely done!!
Really nice piece of work, I particularly like the effect in the eys.

Hi @itseez3d I am using your great software but I am getting difficulties on printing them in color. Have you ever tried to print them in color? If successfull can you show us a guideline to follow? I uploaded a model which I tried printing. I know there is shadows but I dont expect colors to come out that bad. https://sketchfab.com/models/aec11a22f32f4c95a396b0737d4a390c

André :  I like very much the details and the softness of the model. Itseez3d is a great soft!
@André Thank you for the feedback!
@BaykushKoma Sorry for a delay. Just saw your question. We have answered it at support@itseez3d.com
this work with Sense?
@tbrazilc4d Tanya was scanned with itSeez3D app www.itseez3d.com and Structure Sensor. iSense can be used instead of Structure Sensor.
It does not appear to accept the iSense.

@bartv Sorry!
In photography, single portraits are taken at focal lengths from 85mm EFL (equivalent focal length) and higher (135mm, 200mm). This gives a natural perception of the features and proportions of the figure and face. Especially when shooting with the camera angle:

data.mactechnews.de/429282.jpg

Since the 3D model can be twisted as you like, sometimes there are very strong perspective distortions, typical for wide-angle optics. I recommend not to use the default value of 45 degrees when the project is published on a sketchfab. Look for a comfortable value in the range of 5 to 30 degrees. And the larger the portrait (head, chest, as in this case, half-length, full-length), the smaller angle of view is to use. I think it will be quite comfortable value of 15-20 degrees.
Very nice!

Waiting the game... REALY HARD NOW...
I got to watch this, heard a lot about it! Staff Pick!
@seori Thanks ! ^_^ 
Well, to be honest. Script isn't the strong part of Little Witch Academia. It has great Art-style, but story is atleast medicore. It has it's moments, like episode about gold-fish/or one which takes place in Finland. But the main plot is nothing special.
I've heard that the English dub on Netflix cut it in half so the story is very lackluster. There's a bit of hype around it so maybe it's the art style bringing in people?
How can I download It?
Fantactic
oh gosh so perfect!
This looks awesome! How's you do the outline thing?!
@davidknief Oh, that's tricky. You need a single-sided mesh, specially folded in specific way.  I needed to check if it's visible from prefered angles, and not visible from the other angles at the same time.
This akko looks so cute! Thanks for your work!
@sawanomika Oh my! I didn't expected that! I really like your works! Your studio create great anime. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt was my favourite one. I hope you will like my future works. And fan-arts ;-) Thank you! I can't belive it's real!
So cool! It's very well done and your goal is very accomplished!, It's really like the 2D reference sheet.
I'm a Akko and LWA fan to <3 so I'm very happy to found this!
I love it!
HOW. This is awesome!!!
is so cool!! Are you using MAYA? and 3DMAX?
@wei-zheng-tai No. I made everthing in blender. But it's also possible in maya, or 3dsmax. Almost each 3d software which allows you to switch a normals of 3d mesh.
null
This is so cool! I'm new to this site, but is there any way to download this?
@emilqwinten9 Sorry :/
Did you create your own front/side images from the charactersheet or just used them?

And did you use the Blender sculpt tool?

I'm really curious because I'm also modelling stuff in Blender (It's really awesome imo!)  but as of now I only created cubes/cylinder/spheres to create models and maybe add a subdivision surface on it.

Can't wait to try it in VR. Make sure you use our edit VR settings to set up the right scale for others to enjoy! Staff Pick!

PS - the texture atlas add on is a huge time saver!
Hi @paulchambers3d, Thank you very much for your comment and the Staff picking!! So cool :) I hope the scale for the VR viewing is correct, I'm really not used to this. It's 4.64 for now, but if it's not appropriate, don't hesitate to tell me the way to follow.
Very nice scene, I will try with Gear VR for sure.
DOF looks great
Great work!

Enjoy :)
nice work
I set up the VR scale for you - down from 4.64 where the entire scene was knee high to 0.075 where it's human scaled. I also set the initial view point within the scene. Looks great in VR!
A few wild dogs and a crow, done.
Fantastic work!
Great model! gg
Just wanted to let you know that this was featured on our social media! Congrats!
@paulchambers3d @tojek_vfx @james @ruslans3d @bartv @marvez @gendragon3d @tribble42 @seori Thank you all! Another scene will come soon :)
Just wanted to say, I'm super impressed with your model, loved the details.... but one question for you.   I'm a new user of Blender software, but when I downloaded your .blend file, there was only one texture file in it. All the rest were missing files with external file references to your local drive.   Am I doing something wrong during the download, or have you decided not to issue the textures?
Hi @ritchiebb5 First, thank you for the compliment :) Concerning the textures, it's due to the fact that the file upload in sketchfab's free account is limited to 50 Mo and the textures I baked in blender are about 100 Mo. So the image textures are not packed in the .blend file I uploaded, I had to reattribute each one of them to the correct mesh in the 3d settings editor in Sketchfab! This is certainly not the best method but I'm pretty new to 3d modelisation too, especially in Blender, and I still have a lot to learn. 
Here is a link where you can download all the baked textures : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_qvAgUJuug7RWVMR1h4b3J0RGs?usp=sharing
You will just have to set the correct path in the blend file ;)
And for the world shader, I'm using the pro lighting skies demo from blenderguru : https://www.blenderguru.com/pro-lighting-skies-demo/

I hope this will answer your question.
Hi Aurelien,   Thanks for the baked textures.  I've downloaded the files and re-attached them to the blend file. I'm now working through the other missing textures from texture.com (the 15 file daily limit means it will take a few days... but I'll get there....) The more I look at the work you've done on the textures, the more impressed I am. (I now know I've still got a lot more learning to do...)

One last request, I have also downloaded your abandoned warehouse, which has the same sort of missing baked textures, would you be willing to share them as well?

Looking forward to seeing your next model....
Hi @ritchiebb5,
Now you can download the final file of this scene before it was adapted for sketchfab (particule systems are not converted for the baking, for instance). I've also packed all the textures in the blend file (should help!)
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_qvAgUJuug7RWVMR1h4b3J0RGs&usp=sharing

You can also download the abandoned warehouse there : https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_qvAgUJuug7TGlyZm5jelRnZUU&usp=sharing

Enjoy :)
Hi Aurelien,  
I have just downloaded both of your expanded blend files and they now look complete.
Once again, thanks for your generosity in sharing your hard work with us all.  It looks like I will be able to learn a lot about creating such detailed scenes and work toward making my own in the future.
Hi @ritchiebb5 !
No problem, you're very welcome. In fact, I've learned quite everything thanks to the blender community so it's normal to share in return.

Here is a great tutorial from Blender Guru about painting and blending textures:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37oBqhjDtBI

And I've also learned a lot from this guys :

Thanks Bart! Although, there are so many awesome models nowadays I feel I don't deserve to be there!
Hi Julio, sorry for asking you newbie questions. How do you make that info tab? I want to make something like that in my class project.
Hi Yassir! if you mean the annotations: Settings > Annotations > Double click wherever you want to add the first annotation and the rest is pretty straightforward

@blackcatmignon want them on an email?
how would i go about adding the textures? im new to 3ds max
when i import to blender nothing apears can you upload a .obj version pls
Excelent work
Luv eet!
Got some problems with the textures, too. When I import the model into maya all surfaces are messed up. Same when I import it into Unreal Engine.
@gumml want the textures by email?
also, is the mesh fucked up, or is it the textures that get fucked up?
Guys, check the description for other file formats
@FilipAAOfficial No need, i didn't do the model, i just converted it to multiple file types and made it look good on sketchfab. I don't even know original author, so credit anonymous.
Hey man - doesn't seem to be rigged? Opened the obj in Maya and its just a model
Ah no worries, found it was a C4D rig, not a maya/mobu - no worries, I'll re-rig it :)
tANK YOU
Cool
SIIIIIIICCCCCKKKKKK!!!!
Amazing!
Thanks so much dude!
lol
Excellent ! thanks a lot :)
Hi! Does anyone here have this model rigged for 3ds Max? Or is it just me who cant get it to import correctly?
I managed to rig it myself in 3ds Max. Great work with the model!
you are a legend <3
Jesus...

This model is so highly detailed!
this model is amazing! used Mixamo.com to get this model rigged and then used in cinema 4d to create some awesome renders!
 for a beginner anyway!, but thank you for this great model!
I need a Darth Vader please.

Very very nice! And if you don't mind me asking, how did you do the hair, eyebrows and eyelashes? What software and maybe a tutorial?:)
The texturing is ???
Great Eyes!
Really nice, staff-picking it!
Wonderful job!
Nice textures!
Really beautiful! Love how realistic the skin looks.
Interesting to use the emission channel for a designated hair sheen.  Seems like it'd be great for stills since you can control exactly where the shine goes on the hair regardless of lighting, which is exactly what would make it not ideal for animation. Good work overall :)
Wow! That's good.

Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryi_pYqcavs
This model uses scanned textures from real person, since it is from the game Until Down.

Wonderful! Deserves a Staff Pick :)
nice ! :) , too bad i can only see the armatures and no mesh.
@gem what kind of platform (OS, Graphics card) are you watching this on? If you see only the armatures this usually means your system doesn't have enough power to handle real-time animation.
@bartv its Windows7 64 Bit intel core i7-4790, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti.
@gem Sounds like a good spec to handle this animation.
I nearly have a similar system.
Windows7 64 Bit, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930MX CPU @ 3.00GHz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M X2 SLI.
I guess it's your browser which caused this display problem.
Do you use Chrome?
yes Chrome as my default browser. i cant even view my previously posted model with animation. my model works on unity3d maybe its my browser.
@gem My brother has the same problem with viewing it in Chrome.
I use Firefox as default browser, and i tested it in IE and Opera, no problems.
yup thanks :) right now i can view your dragon XD thanks
excellent .
@DennisH2010 I can only see the armature
I like how the body of the Dragon is well made, the wing look awkward to me, but it looks great.
@2-Head_Dragon Thanks, yes wings are difficult, it was the first try to make animated wings.
Amazing!!!!! just Amazing!!!
This was so amazing ^^
What did you used to sculpt this dragon?

Am I being dumb here, or are the dragon/baron pits on the wrong sides of the river?
you're not :D I hadn't notice lol I don't know why they're this way.. :) this is an export from the ingame files directly with no modification so I don't know how it happen :D
I must spend too much time on twitch :)   I can only imagine one of the axis is mapped weirdly - but then the bitmaps would need the same treatment.  It's one of those mysteries only interesting to a tiny proportion of the planets population :)
OMG, you're right o_o, the whole map is inverted!! I think that happen during the import.. Don't know if its my fault or blender :\

Anyway, the shop with the boat should've be at the top right not bottom left :D mistery solve sir ^^ just make a scale on Y -1 and you got the good positioning for everything ^^
If i re-upload with the good positionning, I had to re-assign all the textures?? (there's tones..)
Mystery solved :)  I think the model is fine as it is - as it's for study only.  Great upload, regardless of the inversion.
I did the re-upload anyway :p now its cool ^^ thank you db9dreamer ^^
this is weird.. sketchfab now set the view as HD and don't let changing to sd :\ now the model is ultra long to load..
How did you extract it?
I used RAF manager to datamine the lol files and a dds to obj tool to make the convertions
Hi,
When i import it to unity from blender, it came without any texture, do you have a way to import it correctly to unity3D ?
Sorry for the double post, i found the problem. I need to assign the textures by myself, but when i import the map, a lot of things changes , how can i import it to unity correctly?
I have an information about the bug, it invert the ground and put it rotated while the the other objects are at the same rotation. I really dont know why..
Make a FBX instead of an OBJ, and for the textures, make sure you use an unlit material !!! good luck :) And remember you CAN'T DISTRIBUTE ANYTHING YOU'LL PRODUCE WITH THIS STUFF, even if it's for free !!! This is just to study :) (except if you have a permission to do it from RIOT ^^)
Of course, its just for study. I fixed the texture problem, my main issue is that the ground of the map is reverted when i import it to unity as an FBX (or as anything else).

Do you know about this issue and do you know how to fix ?
You have to flip the normals OR remove the backface culling for this mesh in unity
How to flip the normals ?
blender, edit mode, ctrl+n, check inside checkbox in the option panel
Can't use this for 3d Videos? :'(
feel free to find the turets in the files of the game or on the net my friend ;)
@gabscarmelo77 I can't tell exactly nor give you any permission since I'm not working at riot. But In my opinion, I think you can use it for game footage or highlight gameplay video!
Can I open this in Cinema 4D

A high price tag for a model with such low detail and not processed geometry
What technology is photogrammetry, a dome?
@chamfear The price for my models is due to the high cost of production. Low detail is a contentious issue ...
@3DCap In later works, the detailing is higher, it would be unfair to equalize the price tag for the quality of the product?
@3DCap Well, with such a grid, I think that the price should be lowered three times, it's just an unprocessed piece of data
@chamfear thanks for the advice

@dennis.boelke Danke Dennis ;D
Der Name scheint sehr beliebt gewesen zu sein, He? :D

Du hast nicht zufällig nen super geiles tutorial davon, oder kannst mir eins empfehlen? ^^
Hab manchmal noch echte Probleme mit topology bzw polyflow und Details baken
@dennis.boelke 
Einen speziellen Tutorial habe ich jetzt nicht aber ich finde den Polyflow deiner Modelle gut. Ich denke das ist einfach nur eine reine Übungssache. Also ich modelliere immer erst im Lowpoly Bereich und verfeinere dann meine Modele bis hin zu Highpoly, so habe ich eine einfache, übersichtliche und gute Kontrolle über den Polyflow.
So mach ich es ja ach :D
naja^^
hab besonders an den Rundungen und Ecken Probleme damit - reflektiert dann ständig so komisch.
Nice!! perfect...

I invite you to learn my job ... I'm a beginner, my job someday be as professional as yours.

thanks for joining the World of Tanks Diorama contest! Together with the Wargaming team we'll be picking the winners on Wednesday. Until then, you should try to get as many views and likes on your model as you can - they are included in the judging process. Consider posting your model on Facebook or Twitter, and sharing it with your own World of Tanks communities, or on other game design communities.

The final selection will be announced on Thursday. Good luck!!
You've won 1st place in the World of Tanks contest, congratulations!! We'll get you your prizes as soon as possible.

The target engine will give it on average a single blinn phong highlight and an undithered cubemap. With no SSAO nor BRDF to speak of.
To me it seems counter intuitive to preview it with the intent to distance it from how it actually looks.

Conversely, Sketchfab lacks refraction as well as any implementation of flowmaps. I cannot make any orange portions resemble even a static version of how it appears in an engine 13 years old. So I left them opaque.
Looks perfect for a Half-life 2 remastered edition!
download pls
How to download it?
Plz Donwload this model.
Hey,man ! I m interested in recruiting people for HL2 inspired project. Would you try to work or no ?
could we possibly get a download link for this? I'd love to use this in a VR project
@firestorm185 Recovered the archived thread. Check the description.
Would you mind if I used this for my SteamVR Home workshop map? This gravity gun looks awesome and has the perfect amount of detail for a VR prop. I'm currently using the HL2 world model, and it's a bit lacking in the detail department.
@rectus Source files are in the archive thread above. Go nuts.

Really nice! I'm giving this a staff pick.
@bartv Thank you Bart, that's mean REALLY a lot for me. ( huge fan of blender)
Oh! Was this made in Blender? If so, could you add the #blender tag so I can consider this model for my weekly post on BlenderNation? Thanks :)
@bartv 
Oh, no, I apologize for the misunderstanding caused. I'm just a big fan of the blender and main part of my job going through it, but sculpting in blender not so convenient for me now as in zbrush, in which this model was made.
Ah sure, no worries :)
This is very nice art style, the colors go well.
Cool work
Fantastic work. Excellent anatomy study and very much style at hand painted 

sorry4myEN :)
lol
Could you make Noodle from Gorillaz? (phase 2)
how did you get this topology? Zremesher or something else?
@caplanmaor It's decimation master with keep polypaint function enabled
Lovely.
wow i love her. i would like animate.
sweeeeeet
Absolutely stunning x
BEAUTIFUL GIRL!!
Such wonderful work.
love it, very nice work
This is awesome! What program did you use?

Thanks so much @interiorsdjcad for taking the time to attend the talk. For everyone else a video summary of Sketchfab can do for you as an educator and educational creator is available on our TILT vimeo account: https://vimeo.com/161186943

We hope it inspires you to create more amazing Sketchfab models!
@tilt Hi! I tried to download your file, so that I could 3d print it and use for for a demonstration/education segment.  However, when I open the file, it just shows me a large red box with a small gold structure inside that somewhat represents the tracheal rings, with the epiglottis, but it all looks significantly different from the model posted here.  Is there anyway, you can guide me properly, or possibly send me an STL file for this so that I can print it correctly, and give proper acknowledgement to your university center?

Thank you!
@shodhans Hi and thanks so much for using our models. We've tested the download file on our side by importing it into Autodesk Maya and it shows up ok. Can we ask what 3D program you are using? It might be the program or the way that it's being imported. We are happy to send over an .stl file separately. Please send an email to our medical artist at a.x.campbell@dundee.ac.uk and she will follow up with you.
@tilt Thank you for replying so promptly!  I'm glad to hear that the file is working well on your end.  I will surely contact your medical artist shortly, so that I can get the appropriate file and such so we can progress forward with our education here. =)
Hello! I am very interested in downloading this .stl to use as demo, but the download button isn't working. Is it possible to send to me?
Hi @blueblairy great to hear from you. Give this link a try for downloading the .stl and let us know if it doesn't work for you: https://uod.box.com/s/3gshagisxmigfebxrbivb2b5l6i8jnn3
HI I m a voice teacher, thank you so much for this unique video for sharing with credits.
I will also would like to ask - if you will do the moving part animation - actually showing the movment with the muscles.
of the Larynx.
thanks very much
Orya
I downloaded it, transfor to STL and printed. The trachea part is too thin so it wont be printedd. If you plan to 3dprint it, you should give more thicknes because cura won't make it.

Any way, awesome model. We are aleredy using it in the classroom.
Awesome model @tilt - I downloaded the Maya and the .stl files and wanted to check the dimensions of the .stl file. Are they to scale for a female / male? The .stl file looked bigger than I expected. 

@i.delamo As the .stl file is pretty thin for 3D printing - did you create a new model with thicker walls? I attempted to do so with Blender & Meshmixer, before printing with Cura, but I think there are issues with the model.
@gemhen I will give it another try but not any time soon. If you improve it in any possible way, please tell us.
Fresh and clear..good model!
Hey, I've seen a few comments regarding converting to and STL file. Does the link below work? It's hard to tell since I can't preview it. 
If not, is there a reliable source to convert to .stl? 
Cheers!
@Elsy.Brazzy you can also download the model here and use the open source tool MeshLab to convert it for you: http://www.meshlab.net/
@bartv Thank you so much for your super speedy reply. The 3D printing service have said they can read the file. Woohoo!
Thanks for your help.
Hi there, so the 3D print lab said that it stops printing half way through. For sure anyone know if this works on some, but not all 3D printers? I'm not really sure of what kind of questions to ask the lab, or why this might be occurring. Has anyone got any suggestions? If really love if this model was to work. 
Much appreciated.
@bartv 

how do we use meshlab to convert the fbx file? many thanks
@tilt this is a great model, I'm excited to try printing it. I uploadd it to Thingiverse at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2450399

Please let me know if attribution, etc is inappropriate.
Really awesome work... I would like to take the help of this model to teach my students..

Very nice job!
Thanks guys!
You're on BlenderNation! http://www.blendernation.com/2014/09/01/interior-scene/
I can notice some seams very visible when mipped, did you bleed from uv shells ?I really like softness of pillows and BeanBag. When viewing from close up visible strech on UV's in some places. also seems like light is bleeding where you have a seam maybe to tight packed UV shells.
@zonder - most of the seams are only visible in Sketchfab, so I think is a mix from the tight uv shells and the mipmap thing. Specially on the window and selling.

I also ran a despeckle filter on some textures, that did ruin some of their edges. This was my first baking, so I learned a few things that I shouldn't have done.
@andzbrazil - switching your diffuse maps to bilinear filtering help a lot the seams, but you have a lot of separate materials, which would be tedious, and I don't know if the texture quality will suffer too much. Maybe you could just do it for the ceiling and other big, obvious seams?
@PadreZippo - That did help a lot, thank's for the tip. The floor got a bit noisy but the overall lines are gone, specially on the ceiling, shelves and seat. I guess the remaining light leaks are due to the fact that I didn't weld the remaining geometry.
Wow, this is amazing! It makes me want to read a good book!
Hello, i'm curious, how much time does it take you to make such a beautiful scene?
Thanks for the comments.

@Thibaut Noah - it's hard to tell because most of the models I already had. Building up the scene and fooling around with the texture baking took about 2 days to get  it working.
Hi Anderson,

I really would like to know how you accomplished this.  From baking to creating the interactive animation.  I am trying to baking a scene and it is taking forever.   In the baked objects do not have the clarity that yours do.  I love it.  I have a project coming up.  A house and the client wants this type of interactive ability for his project.  Any advice would be great.  I can even pay you if need be to get me up and running on how to do this efficiently and effectively.  My email is aaron@aaronsmithey.com.
@asmithey - I had to bake object by object, and objects that had more than one material I had to bake them into a new material. It is really time consuming and for some reason the render is much much slower than you'd expect. So I guess that there is no way out than do this laboring procedure.  There are suposed to be some script to automate the baking process but I didn't investigate them further.

The interaction came from Sketchfab, I didn't do anything other than chose the navigation style, which you can also switch clicking on that eye icon (viewer mode).  If you want a deeper navigation and interaction style I'd advise you to look into Blender's own game engine or if it's necessary to be web based, Unity3D.
Hi Anderson,

Yes it seems very labor intensive to me.  I am using the Bake Tool 1.2.  You can load up multiple objects.  I am working through my issues with that.  The scene looks really nice.  To what resolution ad how many samples did you render to?  Thanks
About 1000 samples and resolution of 1024x1024 each. I also used a denoise filter on the rendered textures.
Out of curiosity what GPU are you using?


Thanks
nVidia 770 with 4GB of VRAM.
You should try to add some new effects like bloom. They are now available on sketchfab :)
Great job
Anderson, how you make the walls unvisible?

Very nicely weathered and scratched. Also love the choice of materials.
loved it!
Very nice work here!

Just one question.

Where does the head go?
Awesome work!
very cool, but why is the heads up display so clearly visible no the outside of the helmet?
@inkwhiz888 i just liked the exterior hud idea since it broke up that uniform glass surface. @mediajolt the wearer's head would fit in as normal. I just tucked the cables in underneath as if the helmet were stored on a shelf or something. On the full armor set the cables would connect to a backpack
Nice materials, looks cool on sci-fi head
Hey, just wanted to let you know that this was featured on our social media! Congrats!
It's amazin!
It's VERY nice.  my main criticisms would be that the reflections, while looking very interesting based off of the colors, seem a bit odd when you see the building and flowers in it.  the other main thing is that the texture is clearly mirrored over the center axis.  the things that give it away are the scorch marks on the sides are very recognizable.  also the writing on the heads up display is clearly backwards.  the overall model is absolutely beautiful, the PBRs are expertly used, and the poly count is perfect for most projects, but those were the few things that caught my attention.  great work either way :-)
Cool!
hay how did you achive the glowing higlight on materials.
gr8!!
Thanks so much for the positive reception guys! @seori I'm so pumped that you guys gave me the opportunity to be featured on the platform and for the staff pick! It's the best compliment I could've gotten from an artist perspective so thank you. @heero6528 great observations man! Trying to make interesting details that don't call attention to the fact that the uvs are mirrored can be tough. I'll definitely make some tweaks for the next pass.
uh there's a cute face on the underside! how nice!
Nice textures but the damage is simmetryc
Wanted to also let you know that this was featured 3dtotal's Sketchfab - Staff Picks! Congrats!

This one and a few others of yours I would like to download to try to 3D print. Not for resell of course but for personal enjoyment. Is there any way I could get the 3D model
Is this a download or just for view?

DON'T READ THE ANIMATION (because animation can't be readed, isn't a book XD) SEE THE ANIME... it's realy good and very accurately based on the novel :D.

Hi~

I do not know she has Garterbelts.

Have it?


@peluche-nerv


I do not have time to watch the animation again.

3D modeling took me too much time.

Just perfect!
I still had open this tab so I noticed your addition and you did the most accurate job about this model I´ve seen on the web yet.
Damn dude, this is by far and away the best Rem/Ram models I've seen.
Is there any chance of the model becoming available to us or that you give it out for a fee?
I would pretty much love to use it as character model in VRChat or something (non-commercial use)
so cute!!!?0?!!!!
This make me want to work harder and be a better sculptor/modeler!
so far the best one ive seen as well
@SuperOni
???????...
Very good work, it looks as good as a 2D drawing while it's in full 3D and real time!
dowloud?
I feel like this is what you do when you want to create fan-made animations but don't want to take the time to draw the frames. you create a god-tier anime model for each character you want to animate and profit

What software was this made in
@Alex_HTID Autodesk Maya 2016, however you can easily achieve this level of quality if not better using Blender (which is free for everyone). I painted the textures on Photoshop and the music I edited on FL Studio 12.
null
Is this style achieved by adding borders and pixel like textures onto the mesh???
I am beginning to like the style so I was wondering how it was made 
Great work BTW makes me want to play Fire Red ^^
@redmdlee Unlike my other 2 pokemon remake models, this one the outlines are purely painted in the texture instead of having a mix. If you rotate around you can see where I chose the outlines to go and etc. I didn't want to make every side have them and tried to find an equilibrium. If you download the model for inspection (or even inspect here with the model inspector) you can see how I unwrapped the UVs and painted the diffuse texture!

I'm glad you liked it! I also wish you good luck ahead~
Wow, god work!
@debilik Thanks!
@Wesai This is so cool. I want to share this info about our 3D Challenge to win up to 1000 Euro Cash. Hope to see you there community.figurama3d.com/topic/1-challenge-briefing/

ondrejdvorak,

Funny when people say: It's just a theory. They CLEARLY don't understand what theory is.

In science, a theory is not a guess, not a hunch. It's a well-substantiated, well-supported, well-documented explanation for our observations. It ties together all the facts about something, providing an explanation that fits all the observations and can be used to make predictions. In science, theory is the ultimate goal, the explanation. It's as close to proven as anything in science can be.
I wonder if this is the right model to create a UFO
Congrats! We picked your model for the Monthly Art Picks on 3D-Station: http://www.3d-station.fr/2016/03/01/sketchfab-modeles-du-mois-fevrier-2016/

LIGO Does It Again: A Second Robust Binary Black Hole Coalescence Observed
News Release • June 15, 2016
From : 
https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160615


The two LIGO gravitational wave detectors in Hanford Washington and Livingston Louisiana have caught a second robust signal from two black holes in their final orbits and then their coalescence into a single black hole. This event, dubbed GW151226, was seen on December 26th at 03:38:53 (in Universal Coordinated Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time), near the end of LIGO's first observing period (O1), and was immediately nicknamed the Boxing Day event.  From https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160615
LIGO's gravitational-wave discovery is Physics World 2016 Breakthrough of the Year

The Physics World 2016 Breakthrough of the Year goes to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration for its revolutionary, first-ever direct observations of gravitational waves. Nine other achievements are highly commended and cover topics ranging from nuclear physics to material science and more.

http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/dec/12/ligo-gravitational-wave-discovery-is-physics-world-2016-breakthrough-of-the-year
A new article on website   www.ligo.org

http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O1KnownPulsar/

Searching for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars

 One possible source of gravitational waves that could be much more local and would provide a continuous signal is a rapidly-rotating compact object known as a neutron star. We have known these objects exist ever since they were first observed as pulsars. They are the collapsed cores of massive stars that have run out of fuel and undergone a supernova explosion.
To generate gravitational waves a pulsar must have some non-symmetric distortion in its shape - e.g. a mountain - that is not along its rotation axis. There are various ideas about how such a distorted star could form. The distortion could be frozen into the crust or core of the star after it was born in the supernova, or formed from material falling onto the star, or be produced and maintained through extremely large internal magnetic fields

  Gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger observed by LIGO and Virgo

News Release • September 27, 2017

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration report the first joint detection of gravitational waves with both the LIGO and Virgo detectors. This is the fourth announced detection of a binary black hole system and the first significant gravitational-wave signal recorded by the Virgo detector, and highlights the scientific potential of a three-detector network of gravitational-wave detectors. 
On August 17, 2017, the first detection of gravitational waves detected by LIGO ( GW170817 ) and a bright kilonova observed by Eso astronomers and others ( GRB170817A ).  This phenomenon is generated by the merger of two neutron stars in the galaxy NGC 4993.
Really beautiful. I heard about this phenomenon in the podcast Coffee Break of the Canarian Astrophysical Institute, but seeing it in 3D is amazing!
thank you @ville01 , there is another numerical relativity simulation of a binary black-hole coalescence with masses and spins consistent with the GW170104 observation in this animation : https://skfb.ly/6stBr
wow this is crazy your work is crazy good
Thank you @LTPman .

Cool! By the way, I noticed you didn't add a description, categories or tags to your model. It's an important thing to do so it'll show up in the right galleries, getting you more exposure!

We recommended your work for this week's Sketchfab roundup on IAMAG:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-45/

Have a great weekend :)
Awesome
i really like how you made the bird! its so fluffy and cute :D
Hello Maylee, Thank you for sharing your workflow in Art spotlight. It's great to read your experiences to make this model.
Beautiful!
Hi Maylee. Do you have any video on how you did this from blender to zbrush and so on? Would love to watch and learn. :)
I really like the painterly look on the bird :)
very beautiful
Hi Maylee!

I'm celebrating the best Blender art on Sketchfab this week by featuring it in the BlenderNation header, and I'm using your work today. 

Merry Christmas!

https://www.blendernation.com/2016/12/27/contribution-animation-process-breakdown/
Dreamy!
:o i wish i had this!
Two of the best creatures God created. :)
This is just too beautiful and adorable!!!
Hey, fine work! this is adorable, i was wondering, how did you translate the sculpting fur-like visual into diffuse map?
wonderful fox and pretty fun bird!)

@dlfon99 Yes your right xD 
I think it would be better if I replace this with an animated version of one arm.
I uploaded this one, before sketchfab supported animations.
i just add bone and its working for me now i have good hand thank you so much
@Glitch5970  :)
Excellent collection for a very random product design idea I had. Thanks for uploading these!
@dennish2010

That would be a great help, an animation of the arm bending then we can just pause it at any part of the rotation to see the anatomy in that pose!
Nice work.  I like the variety.  Thanks!
@dennish2010 Amazing! Have you uploaded this version with the animation? Thanks
Is it rigged?
cool. I'm hoping to use some of these in an animation about ancient rome (if i do, i'll post a comment with link to vid)
Thank you )

This could serve as analogy for surface receptors on the surface of a cell.  Yes, creepy, but gets a point across.....
@bartv Thank you :)
@dvinal surface receptors of a cell, interesting what you see in this scene :D
Hey, your model is featured on 3D Printing Industry! Congratulations :) See the article here: http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/09/04/free-3d-printable-of-the-week-the-predator/
Chloe Adeline used this hand for his fingerspell page.
Check it out, isn't it a awesome use :)
http://fingerspell.net
I OBJECT! thats all i think when i see this
@docterrok xD
Are these free for use in games? (Ad revenue enabled)
@doctorgibuz 
Yes they are free to use as long the game will be non commercial.
@dennish2010 
Yes they are free to use as long the game will be non commercial.

What if they're are transformed? Hypothetically say change the skin material to fish scales and attach a full arm to them.
Just dropping by to let you know we loved this so much, we featured it on our social media! Hope others love it as much as we do!
Woah! Would be interesting to make a whole garden out of these..
NICE JOB!!
This should be exposed in a museum of modern art, for real!
@nykaibr Thanks, I would call it just a test no.105 xD
wtfreak
@Alex_oberski :P
Surreal and kinda spooky. Nicely done. :)
Really cool! and spooky alright ... kinda worried for a minute you'd start with the middle finger lol
This is awesome. I decided to perform a deep style transfer into the depth map of a frame in this model. Came out rather interesting https://imgur.com/gallery/VukorK6

@mikebarrington nice move Mike :)
They love you over there! This is awesome, great use of annotations!
Thank you!  Yeah, it jumped up considerably overnight.  My eyes about bugged out when I saw the count this morning.
Nice textures!;)
Annotation 5 gave me a sad...
It's been a while since the contest, but I figure this still deserves to be staff picked!

Amazing Work! I am a 3d scanning enthusiast and have tied that into my work in equipment financing. 
I actually have many people that would be interested in your 3d scanning technology for projects they have currently as well as projects they are developing. 
I would love to meet at CES hope you will be there and available to speak! 

Thanks and please keep up the amazing work,

Grat job!
hi,my school's library can print 3d models freely and it needs me to provide files with .cube format. Simultaneously I want to download materials from you (I like your models) but i find the format has something different from our school requirement. So what should i do? Excuse my poor English. Looking forward to your help, 3Q!
@soveronica - the .cube format is a proprietary format from Cubify / 3D Systems.

1) Download this OBJ file.
2) In software like MeshLab ( http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/ ) you can convert it to STL.
3) Download the Cube software associated with your school's Cube model ( e.g. http://cubify.com/en/Products/Cube2TechSpecs )
4) Import the STL, and Build it, which exports a .cube format. Make sure to check with the printer for material type, etc.
I like so much!
@PadreZippo Thank you for your kindest reply! I have coped with it and submitted this piece of work to the work e-mail of my school's library~ Have a nice day!^_^
Why has the top of his head been cropped off?
@wicket they didn't have a ladder :P
Download hint needed. I get a the following message  Unknown filename  and download button is inactive - What am I doing wrong?
I like so much, thank you!
really cool
Great model! Amazing to be able to download and print such a beautiful piece of Art, thank you so much for the nice upload!
Impressive model! Can I have more on this?
Printed out in high glossy crystal yellow PETG. Directly sliced the *.obj file in repetier-host 1.6.
very good
Thanks for sharing this model. I remember first hearing of Easter Island and the moai in an old issue of National Geographic and being enthralled. Of course, in the 1970s in rural Texas there weren't any models or much else in the way of reference materials to get a better sense of the shape and mass of these fascinating sculptures. Now I can look at an actual example. Wow!
This model has been nominated for our new Cultural Heritage 3D scanning column!

Great 3D model.

Hey, I removed the category Products & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.

:) hi there again,i have pretty  curious question :) you used lightmaps on secondary channel or you hand painted everything ? ,or you just pre-baked lightning and stuff? :)
no, @spybg there are only my hand painted) but sometimes I baked AO and apply to 50 percent or lower
with AO I get a much nicer picture
:) @apsnu you did great job,Love how it turned out at the end,you have unique style :) keep up the great work yang lady :)
Again good work....
Whole scene is amazing ,
but How the lights blend in a hand painted textures is the best part...

Its reminds me on endless hours spent on King´s Bounty ;D

http://www.blendernation.com/2015/04/29/tutorial-basic-basketball/
Wow! That's really cool! Thanks, @Bart
I mean, @Bartv
You're welcome :)
There's some really weird clitching going on with the water cup, but it actually makes it look more like water! :D
Thanks @Moshugan, water its actually a volume, so it has faces that collide with the bowl's faces. I noticed it until I uploaded the model, but, yes, it really seems like water, so I left it just like that ;)

Hey i'm kinda new to blender, and I just can't figure out how to bring him to the t-pose, do you know how? (and not by manually moving him into the t-pose)
Great model :)
Hey man! Your render is so cool but I have a problem, when I download it then I don´t know how to use it on render, can you help me?
@MeowMilk press alt+r and alt+g. make sure you have all the bones selected.

Very nice job, normal map is may be pushed just a little too much but I like the work on hair and skin.
The eyes are very accurate...
Should be listed for staff pick in my opininion !
omg, one of the best models I've ever seen. the details are incredible.
It's probably the most perfectly realistic face on Sketchfab so far. You're really evolving at each new face, it's impressive. You've got some issue though on the neck seams. If you're using 4K textures, you may want to push the padding/bleeding at 32 pixels. If you're using 2K textures, at 16 pixels. This avoids seams issues. 
Very good idead also to use specular/glossiness as a workflow as it enables to get this colored effect reflection on the eyes. Really excellent work.
Mind blowing realism!

You should know the subtle facial hair that go all the way up to the cheeks doesn't go unnoticed and looks very good.
This is madness!
Cool! I'm giving this a staff pick.
WOW!. Just WOW!
We featured your model on Instagram!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BkOi4hQjBzR/
I Hope this is not a lame question but, How did you make the facial hairs, is that hair cards? or something?
So many hair cards?

It looks like a shader. If you zoom in on the head hair it's fading strangely.

What's your technique? :D

Thanks.

Hi Max, the OBJ export is missing vertex normals (vn lines).
Thanks !
It would be great to see the new Yamato model be published, as this is still the old one
Hey maxromash, can you make models from world of warplanes or world of Tanks? Thank you for the Yamato model, your collection is very helpful!
null
I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this yet - there's a piece missing in the tower behind the funnel.

i.imgur.com/Yk6vaCQ.png

It's there in the preview image, but missing in the downloaded model - leaving the top of the tower mysteriously floating in mid-air. Also missing from your Musashi model.
One flaw of the Yamato: The ratio of AA guns to turrets is less than it should be. Another flaw of the yamato: gun tower armour and poop deck armour. Other than that the yamato was the perfect ship.
My only model so far is the yamato, it was originally Nassau, then 8 republished it as another ship, The Yamato.
nice
Congratulations on reaching 1000 followers - it's great to see more people discovering your work! 

Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@nikkytae no time
@icabrantes welp... would wanna see your interpretation of him. :x
sir can you make this model downloadable? i want to make a pepakura file for it thanks
@kasasaom it already is if you read the description of the model.
Downloaded the model but I changed to fbx and ported it to Blender. Had to redo the bone structure completely do to that but got it working again. Then put into Unity and now got it working in VrChat. I'm going to try to recreate the weapon trail/eye you made but in Unity. Just wanted to say this model you created is amazing and glad someone made Goblin Slayer. I recorded some while in VR but I somehow lost the recording, so I only got this screenshot while I was testing the model.

@Minst_Meat whoa man, nice job!! :oo putting stuff from maya to Blender is no joke, specially to put it into a game after that. :x for the weapon trails or eye trails you'll probably have to research a bit more on Unity's side of the program, since the trails are solely from maya only. hopefully you've read the documentation to see how it's done in maya. that's pretty much all i can help you with here man. hope you manage to get the stuff to work!! :D
@Minst_Meat Hi, am trying to get the model into unity and vrchat as well, if i may ask, how did you get it to work with the poly limit?
@Rotol you can remove the outline mesh if necessary, it'll half the poly count. hopefully it helps.
@nikkytae Yep that and a bit of decimating it did the trick, thanks.
And thanks for the great model you did.
@Rotol no problem, i gotta apologize on my side for the bad model. a lot of edges were not really necessary but were there anyway, which probably caused the problem. thanks for your patience too.
@Rotol I've been having trouble fixing the skeleton in Blender once I convert it from .mb to .fbx. Would it be possible to get a download link to your .fbx file for Goblin Slayer for VRChat? In return, I'll throw in PDF links to Goblin Slayer light novels 2-4 translated in English.  

Btw, as long as the tris are less than 60k, you can safely bypass the poly count limit in VRChat. It actually isn't a huge resource hog. 

Great work, Nikkytae!
@anotherredlineday I used mixamo to do the basic rig and then fixed the problems the skeleton had with weight painting in blender.

Not sure how to send it to you, if you want i can send it to you with discord( if you use it)
@Rotol Sorry for not responding to everyone, haven't been on. Seems you guys figured it out but yes I halved the poly count outline mesh,decimating,fixed weight painting. To answer redlines issue, since it was a Maya skeleton its useless for blender. Your either going to need to create a skeleton yourself or use something like mixamo. I had issues with the model for in vr, so I had to go back and fix it but now its fine. Now i'm working on animations in game for Mr. Slayer.
null
null
@anotherredlineday thanks! the model is actually 40+K without outlines, so if you can use a native renderer for toon rendering in Unity i believe it'll be more efficient for you guys.
@Rotol Could really use that .fbx link if you've got 5 minutes, my discord is ALonelyManatee#9016 and thank you @nikkytae this model looks absolutely stunning and i can't wait for the show that is now in the works!
@Alonelymanatee Sure, ill send it directly with discord
@Alonelymanatee thanks, haha. i've got much to improve, so you can leave that comment for next time. xD
@Rotol could i have it as well? i'd like to see what yall have done with it xD
@nikkytae I can send you my copy if you would like.

Nice work.
love that texture work !
A little too stiff and manly of a posture but that's what you would expect from a knight girl. Right?
love the layering of the hair and those PAULDRONS!! amazing stuff.
Fantastic design, she looks capable without looking cheesy/fan service-y.  The texturing is really well done. love it.  Is this an original design or part of a game?
Do you have any tutorials or anything like that? I would love to see how you make something like this.

Please put it on Unity3d asset store!
fantastic
This is really awesome. Love the painted aesthetic. How do you go about posing your character? Do you model them in the pose or do it afterwards?
I loved it! How did you make this texture?
Just perfect! <3
Wow! I like how you managed to incorporate the bird face design into even the axe as well as the armor
omg so beautifull
Wow!! An amazing model.

Hey 16NIS, if you're going to make the puppet character from FNAF2, this is what he looks like, http://i.imgur.com/Vd4G53c.png

how can i maybe put these in gmod
It cool!
ye how can we get them on gmod
You works is really great,but there problem in her eye texture,is not like her eye from FNAF 2 (link for pictures:http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141111073937/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/3/30/TC_Icon.png) but anyway is really great work and if edit her eye texture is really will be Awesome [sorry if I make is worst for you :,(]
how i can download this model?
How the heck do I scroll up on the model? :c

can you fixed the darkness on the inside when the beak is on, the toes and she also has red cheeks
pink cheeks actually
anyone else notice her endoskeleton eyes follow you?
@AMG lol i just noticed that
did anyone else get a lag spike when they pressed demo?
of course , no one FREAKIN LISTENS TO ME >:(
How I can scroll down the model?
@mr.lopinhos hold right click and move the mouse around
@FerventFlames this isn t work, need someone driver to make this?
umm, its says published a month ago

so i dont really get it, why you not giving the link or why its not in steam..?
or does its means when you uploaded toy chica?
@pinkquepancakes These models are being comissioned by the map creator Keithy which means Keithy is paying I6NIS for the models so they will not be released until Keithy's map is complete.
@mr.lopinhos I don't know what to tell you

@michaeljordan4chat 

Hi Chuka! For this model i use Zbrush. One of the few software that allows you to work in an organic way, without worrying about polygonflow, and topology until you've finished.
Perhaps I will say some obvious things.
Usually (if I have to work on a model with realistic proportions) I prefer to start with an anatomical model based, already cut where it's needed in POLYGROUP, is a model that I created long time ago and I use it for these cases. Like this.
Then I found the reference that I needed. Once the model posed the real work begins :P... Sculpting, refining, and so one.

I hope I was helpful, and sorry for my english!
can i download it? ^_^
Download? <3
hello  , I'm looking fir an artist who can help me with a hentai model , if you are interested contact me for more details  at nepystar@gmail.com
Hi there Denny I was wondering if you do consignments and how much would you charge for it?  I have a drawing I did in the 90's and would love to print it in 3D.  Do you think you can help me out.  I love your style and I think it will work well with my drawing.  My Email is Diversityny@hotmail.com.  Hope to hear from you.
Thigh muscles look a little disproportionate. Other than that, it's very nice.
null
@agreshenko Actually I have personally met women who work out with muscles just like these. that includes certain ones bulging out more than others. also remember she is wearing heals and this causes your calves to flex you ass to lift and stick out as well as your breasts.  In fact aside from making a woman taller those are the reasons why they wear high heals. it sure isn't for the comfort.
This looks really good

Hello! I am very interested in downloading this .stl to use with students as demo. Is it possible to send to me? Thank you very much!! 

Best regards.
This is so well done. Thank you. I am an occupational therapist, who teaches in VR about sensory input and vestibular stimulation. This model is so helpful to me, as I could never build it with my intermediate Blender skills. Thanks again.
I am looking for a version of this print in .stl form, does anyone have any suggestions?
nice
This is a very interesting and well-made model, well done, Ms. Campbell! As an audiology-trainee I am looking for models like these. I have downloaded the model and am now looking for a way to be able to view it off-line.
It has been very helpful. Thank you soo much . Being any anatomy student,  its very hard to understand without seeing the actual structure.Its a nice model,  i must say.. But i can't open the downloaded model on my fone,  any advice??
It is a fabolous model, thank you for offering it to the public! I want to use it as .obj model and I am missing the .mtl file to put the textures on the model. Do I only don't find it or is it really missing in the zip-file?(I am preparing a lesson on this for elementary students, so colour would be great....)
Great model...  Thank you for sharing to public!
@frandevol I am having the same issue, it incorporates as a white-only 3D model into powerpoint. Any luck figuring out how to add the textures?
@ctomblinson No, I am sorry. It looks like you have to create the .mtl and the .png files yourself. There might be a chance in converting the model from .obj into another format and colour it there. I (Microsoft user) would try to use 3 D Builder and convert into 3mf, then paint by hand in Paint 3D and save in one of the offered formats again. If you need .obj - save as .3mf, open in 3D builder and save as .obj again. It worked well for some objcts I wanted to use in cospaces, although it is'nt a comfortable way at all..
thank you for sharing :)

Thanks for the nice comments, guys!
And thanks for the staff pick too! wow!
Secret Yoshi's on the top.
Hey mStuff, we've just started playing around with new forum software and some of us have started posting our Nintendo Fan art there, would you care to post yours, too? 

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/share-your-nintendo-fan-art-here/31
I'd love to share it there !
I have a new version coming out, I can post it when it's done :)
Great, looking forward to it!
Nice work mStuff. Yes, I too would love to see the waterfall in place and Yoshi on the roof. Nonetheless, great work!

Thank you for sharing :)
Magnifique
j'essaie de faire la même chose mais il m'est impossible d'avoir mes texture j'ignore pourquoi
You Should Totally build Bowser's castle. That would be so cool.
So cartoony and so real at the same time... How could it be? Incredible.
Thank you so much for making this available.  I edited it in blender so that I could upload it to SteamVR.  Now I can stand inside your 3D creation!!  If you have a Vive you should check it out, everyone is loving it:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701441175
Also, did you ever finish the scene with the waterfall?
Awesome, thanks Azeotrope :)
I have been busy studying since I uploaded this and have only been able to work on Mario-related stuff a tiny bit.. 
Though I have decided to expand on this scene and include a toad town outside as in Galaxy (though with my own layout)
pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=104157
I have also finished the waterfall and expanded the backyard kind of like it was in Mario64
pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=104156
I have a long summer break now, so I will for sure try to finish all of this soon. :)
Can you send me the .blend file with the one that has the waterfall finished?  I would like to update it.  I don't need the one with the back area finished because you can't move around in the environment.
I might be able to send it to you tomorrow -- Late night 4AM here :)
It has been long since I made it, so it most likely needs some touch-ups.
Are you going to be able to get the new model to me? I would like to update it.
I am finishing up my exams, I will have plenty of time from the weekend and on,
I hope it is ok
Looks so awesome man. Great job. You wouldn't happen to have like an interior of the castle, would you?
Just a reminder that I would like the model that has the water in it (also the flowers).  I found your model that has the flowers but it didn't include the water.  I just want to update it on Steam.  Everyone is really really liking this on SteamVR!
dueblade: I started working on it at one point, didn't get too far with it though :)

Azeotrope: sorry for the wait, it's been more than a year since I made this, and I just now realize how unfinished the water part of the scene is, anyways, you can have both of water and plants here http://www.pasteall.org/blend/42420 see if you somehow can make use of it ;) you do know how to append objects from project to project? You should be able to mix a couple of the project files you have found to make a complete one :) Good Luck and thanks for making this old thing VR (Too bad I only have a Gear VR and not a Vive ;) )

Wow! Cool model. Looks like ZiL-131, one used to rust near our apartment back when I was a little kid. It was quiet fun to climb on it.
My new favorite vehicle!
Are you planning on posting another version with the tarp on the back? I only ask because the mesh is there. Another option is viewer API is supported with sketchfabs iframes, but not natively here on Sketchfab. I am building my personal portfolio right now and you might find this useful. https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer)- link on how to embed with API seems pretty straight forward. Cheers! :D
Just stared on it for a while - it's so good looking and so detailed!
oh this is my new favorite model on Sketchfab! :) Just amazing!
Congratulations, Polycount just featured you as one of their favorite artworks on Sketchfab in December! http://polycount.com/discussion/181115/sketchfab-spotlight-december-2016
Nice job!!
Very very very great!
Great!
Just like a real one. Incredible work!
awesome. i want this model for 2d art.
Perfect work with the drive train and the suspension on this one! Loving the tire tread as well.
you are the best

Wow just wow
wooooow !
Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

https://sketchfab.com/bartv/collections/followers-milestones1000
is there a tutorial for doing this?
@Alessandro.Curatelli yeah all you need is a phone that can do a 3D scan. But I wouldn't do what he did because you can get sued. He just scanned a dbz figure and is trying to make profit off it. If you want a DBZ figure buy a real one and support the creators.
nice phone scan of Son Goku SSJ Figure Dragon Ball Z Match Makers. Maybe you should let the fans buy the figure instead of selling an illegal 3D scan of it? Also don't sell copyrighted character models. You don't own the character and you don't have the right to make profit off that. Sketchfab really need to clean up...

Hello, 
I design museums and I need an 1850's era soldier model.  The model needs to be Charging the enemy with rifle in hand and wears gear of the period.  Facial expression is very important.  Can you provide a model for us in a Sketchup scene like this, and what would be the cost?  Email me at patm@mdicreative.net and I will send you a sample photo similar to what we need.  Thanks, Pat Malone, CEO, MDI Creative Inc.

have you any tutorials featuring your workflow?
looks awsome! what type of shaders/material presets do you use?
@PapaPotato He paint it like anime style and use backface for the outline line. it like RWBY style.
@jaynoco @og141896 @SeanWcgi 

Thank you Guys!!:)
I'm glad to see my work,
@dbchest 
Thanks for your comment?

And Sorry, I do not have a tutorial yet
Since I'd like to create works with this taste again in the future, I will consider creating a tutorial at that time
@PapaPotato 

In order to make this work an anime taste, I do not use the shadow by the shader, I am shading with texture.
And the material is composed only of the base color.
Since I wanted to make the skin healthy when it was displayed on the screen, I adjusted the color balance and bloom slightly with the post effect
?I am using automatic translation, sorry if it is difficult to read?
null
Can you please at least describe the creation process. :)
This is amazing! May I ask which software you used?
@ahkai 
Thanks for your comment?
And I'm sorry, it's hard to explain everything in the workflow with text...

@LBFC3D Thanks for replying! Keep up the good work ^^
@LBFC3D Do you have Artstation maybe or youtube, where I can follow you! I really like this model, I am quite curious how you did the whole progress. Well done :)
@LBFC3D i would be very interested in watching that.
Really awesome work! What method did you use for the Retopology?! Its so clean!
@ahkai 
I'm sorry, I just started up modeling, so I have not got my channel yet.

Since I am creating a model between my daily work, I would like to introduce flow etc. if I can make time in the future.

Thank you for your interest in my work!
@wolvski 
Thanks for your comment?

I am using Maya's smooth mesh in the course of all modeling.
So, we do not quad draw etc for the finished model.
It is important to create it so that it becomes a topology that is in a state of smooth mesh.

In doing so, if you create a model that does not use triangular polygons as much as possible,
most of the work in Retopology only removes the edge loop.

The joints are adjusted slightly from the back so as to bend without collapse.

Finally, I am reducing the number of polygons using a game model such as PS 4 as a guide, but if it still gets many, 
I am reducing the parts that do not affect outlines and motion.
?Machine translation so it may be funny sentences, I'm sorry...?

Inaccurate since the FCC data has been removed from the back of the 8
Awesome! Btw the apple logo on the back has little verticies moved to the right, on the top left of the logo.
It shouldn't have a headphone jack...
Really good model. I even noticed the design on the flash for the camera.

Also, you spelled California incorrectly. XD
very nice
This is so cool
I wish this was the iPhone X. But it has a headphone jack...
@Zi7ar21 that is a good thing
I'd like an Iphone X with a earbud jack.
Something happened with an apple, look closely) But model really good

Nice, staff-picking it!
@fox3d super nice! Would be great to have an animated version :)
Very, very nice to see the Dragon all colored and textured now.
Looks almost exactly like Slattern from Pacific Rim! Weird hammerhead head shape, 2 arms, tentacles, long body. It's like the Category V Kaiju from the end of the movie!
I really enjoy its animations! Especially the Biting!
ooh! Look some quartz ima take it!...       AHHHHHHHHHHHH WTF IS THAT! *dies*
Phaota.It reminds me of a(n) snake
Absolutely beautiful
The inactive lava zone is unrealistic. What does this thing even eat? In fact, why are the majority of creatures fish and predators, which are giant fish?
can't wait to see this guy in vr, although not sure i want to meet him face to face.
I love your work so much :D longtime fan of subanutica (since the start!) Keep up the amazing work ! ;)
I've been playing subnautica since I got it that was 4 months ago but this is not what I was expecting this is over awesome
He's even better in-game with his various roars.  :)
yeah he literally is awesome
Amazing!

great model!!!
I tried to download this and other models Renafox, but not download anything, and despite that I get the mail that if you have downloaded, what's going on here?
I really like those windows what process did you use to make the dirt and transparency.
You make really good work ! Added to my following and actually new on my inspiration folder :)
I love it! This is how  3D must be done!
Excellent work! I also find these so appealing; their story comes through so much each time. Really nicely done.

Hi there, how much (aprox) is your commision price in a model like this queality?
@UnChild first tell me what you need it for, if it is for 3d printing or something else so I could give you an approximate value
I really like it.
Can I see the Tpose image?
I'm looking for an animation modeling.
@chocokit talk to my mail to show some render niconaiken3d@gmail.com
How much do you charge for Commission?
@Ludedwolfthat depends on what type of modeling you want
@naiken.nikoi 
Similar to the model above,for 3D printing
@Ludedwolf a job like that for 3D printing would be 160 dollars approximate depending on the design
@naiken.nikoi 

Awsome! I just need two weeks to get the reference materials! Would that be okay?)
@Ludedwolf no problem, I leave my mail for any query niconaiken3d@gmail.com
@naiken.nikoi 
Send you an email:)
I can't find any T-Pose obj file.
@CognitiveV speak to my mail to pass the file niconaiken3d@gmail.com
Great model, same comment as @CognitiveV
Hi I'm an animator in Korea. If I buy this character, can I animate with this in 3ds max 2016 for my animation ?

I've featured your work on BlenderNation:

https://www.blendernation.com/2017/12/18/favourite-blender-art-sketchfab-2017-week-51/

Enjoy :)
@bartv Thanks a lot!
Great, how download this?
@pedro.pimienta.morales Yes, you can
Nice pack! But it seems in the pack for Unity, meshes are all missing materials and in gray :(
@camelyi.lee You should use prefabs and not pure meshes. ;)
Hi, I just purchased this set of models. And I noticed some of the fbx models when dragged into the scene (3js editors), the models are rotated -90 instead of 0,0,0. 
I’ve checked your blender file and the rotation values are not “freeze transform”/reset to 0.  

Please clean up the files so the rotation are standardised across all the fbx models so I will not have to manually correct/rotate them back to 0. 

Thank you very much!
@linchenhsin Hi there and thanks a lot for purchasing my pack - really appreciate it! The .fbx files has -90x because of the gaming engines (Unity3D),
but there should be also .blend file with all the models. There you can select all by a and ctrl+a you could reset all the rotations.
I am sorry for any inconvenience but thats the way it is usually used. 
With kind regards, Pavel
@darkfejzr I see! Thanks for the reply and I really love the models! Great work!
Can you export using collada format?
@luis.boch Hi there, there is .blend file included in the package so you can export whatever format you need from blender, even collada.
If you do a sci fi one I would buy it.
@imdying What models are you looking for in sci-fi?
@darkfejzr evil looking skyscrapers. hover cars. lamp posts. dirty streets. robots. alleyways. billboards. neon signs. etc :)

Really nice work, man. I love the cartoon style pictures on the wall (I often find it's the little things that help sell the scene). What did you do this in?
this is incredible! I am using this for inspiration because it's one of the best works I've ever seen! thanks for sharing
This. This is awesome. I love this kind of model. Congratulations.
Good work, and thanks for the download access ! I'll use it to show what is a low poly scene to my students, if it's okay with you.
This is style that I really like. Your map is very nice!

@nigelgoh Its awesome.What software you use for modelling?
Excellent lighting, well done! :)
Thank you so much about this cute model!!!!
Nice texturing.
What software did you use for the texturing and modelling if you don't mind me asking?
Really nice. Very good texture.
Nice
Awesome!  I like that is it optimized.  It can even run on mobile VR!

@diegoluga My 8 year old kid asked me a question about his skeleton last night. I showed him your model on my phone and was able to answer it! So cool :)
Hello. If you want this model for anatomy studies on medical students level, you should remove the intervertebral disk, add the sacral canal and add a nasal cavity with superior, media and inferior concha nasalis. You can use a CT scan and a segmentation program like Slicer 3d for this purpose. Otherwise, for artistic anatomy teaching purposes, the model is great :)
Thanks very much you all for your coments.
Bart, I am very glad my skeleton was usefull to your kid.
Valchanov. Thank you very much for your feedback. I want this model for artistic anatomy studies. But your advice is also very wellcome. By improoving it using your tips Ill be glad if it can also be be usefull for medical students. And anyway, also for artistic use, a higher anatomy acuracy will always be better.
Thank you very much! :)
Genial! Muy buen trabajo.
can this be animated
@HerobrineArmy It is not specifically concived to be animated, but it could work, provided at least a basic rig. The topology is not prepared for deformation, it is all trys, but as every bone is a different piece, they could move even without deformation, if you dont need complex deformation such as squash and stretch. The only problem I see is dealing with the spine and reeves. Setting a joint and controler for every vertebra would not be practical for animation, and setting up some sort of complex spine sistem and make it move the spine properly is not an easy job. The reeves geometry would need some sort of deformation. They would need a retopology. If you manage to rig it and anímate it, I would love to see it. Good luck!
Wow, I used this skeleton to learn anatomy for the past month a LOT , I could say he´s like family now xD Thanks!
Thank you for free!
null
It would have been much more convenient for my kid's science project if this model was in the same scale, proportions, and pose as the Male Full Body Ecorche model.
Great work!
Very GOOD MODEL!!!
this type of models are a great help in my anatomy drawing classes, thank u!  :D
Hey, would you be able to send me the texture? I can't seem to find it.
Thanks for sharing this Model. It would be used in a Class Education.

Thanks.
Hi, can I use this model for my project at uni? I am creating an augmented reality app. I will credit you in my works. Thanks :)

Énormément plus élégant à regarder (que le modèle de Janvier).
download?
I'd like to download/purchase this model too. Any chance?
@jtorrevillas thanks!
@cyril-levallois we had more specs for this one :)
@astorphobis @martin.dobes this model is only available for viewing for now.
Regarding the environment that you see through the holo lens are there any grids or maps that Microsoft could share, so we could come up with our own scenarios?
Can we have the model to maybe add Danish annotations for display on tv2.dk?

Best regards,

Magnus Bjerg
Well done on the model, one of my favorites. Please share the application and techniques used to create. eg. Max, Maya, Inventor, Solidworks, etc. and the output format. thanks!
@jimboyd This model was created using Blender. There was no needed output format since Sketchfab has an exporter add on for Blender so the model was uploaded directly from the application ;)
Is there anyway to download this 3d model?
It would be great to be able to download for demo purpose.
@Sebastian.Gambolati @turn2vr you can now purchase this model.

Do you know how accurate this model is? I.E could it be used as a guide to 3D print an accessory for the HoloLens?
the model was built using regular photographs as source , no blue print measurements or actual cad resource was used , so you cant use it to 3D print anything you wish to add or replace on the actual device.

Awesome stuff! Might be much to ask, but can you summarize your process? :3
@sidx30 @GesyBekeyei thank you!

@sidx30
process was being summarized in a blog here,?http://tsan38.blog.fc2.com/
but they're negligent recently.?If there is necessary information, please say.
@tsan38  Do you do any type of sculpting? or if you just use polygon modeling, do you use any 2D art while modeling? Thank you so much!
Great work!
@jmihodgson thank you!!

@sidx30
I'm making a model with a hobby. Therefore I feel pretty and make the girl who is Eros. This is a Japanese HENTAI style.
Refer to original animation and illustration because I can't make 2D art.?Thank you.
@tsan38 ahh I see. Thank you for sharing your process! May the hentai be with you good sir! :D
Hiii Which program or which textures/materials/lights/whatever it is.... to make the 3D models to look like cartoons?? it's just so awesomeee :3
OMG it's just bitmaps?
Niiice!
Very nice model and i am impressed with the outline. It is a reversed normals inflated version of the model right?
@bulldoozer88?
The color of this model is only a texture. I do not understand English. 
Therefore,The answer that you request might not have been able to be said. 
thank you.
@thetupi Thank you!

@nikohard
That's right. The model is copied. And, it is reversed. 
It is comprehensible when the wire frame is displayed and it sees in the vicinity. Thank you.
Awesome~!

Hello.
May I help you?
@hnmw
An answer is slow and I'm sorry to be.
This data is a secondary creation work, so it isn't being sold.
Thank you.
@Tsan38 I am currently building a game prototype and have been looking for this style and model quality who can make it. Are you available for commission work?
@konshu
I'm thankful for a proposal.
But there is no time to do other work at present.
Thank you.

Awesome as always!

May I ask why you choose dithering over blending?
@stephomi Thanks! I chose dithering because even though there's a noisy delay in quality, the blending looks better with the rest of the model & the camera noise. More importantly the normal blending had ugly white outlines at some dark areas that I didn't know how to get rid of & problems at overlapping layers with transparency. Dithering doesn't have that problem ;)
this is crazy ahh! amazing!
Hopefully we'll manage to improve our dithering in the future to be less flicker-crazy.

Overlapping layers is indeed bothersome, no easy way to fix that without spliting the mesh in several smaller parts.

As for the white outlines, it's due to texture filtering (combined with premultiplied alpha).
It's still present with dithering (e.g: tibia zone) although barely noticeable.
Switching all the channels to bilinear should make the result a bit better, and switching everything to nearest will make disappear the white edges (this solution is far from ideal though).

The better solution is to bleed or pad all the color (rgb) components of your textures.
E.g: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA2ba4hcRnk (just the part 1:20 to 2:30)
Or http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Edge_padding

Oh, and staff-pick!
Thanks @stephomi !
That fixed it! There's still some small problems but overall it's a much better result with all the small outlines gone.
And thanks for the staff pick :D
That feet study model inspired me too... But I didn't get to go anywhere with it. This is excellent.
Wow, impressive! i love that translucent aura effect <3
awesome!
I'm shocked, this is one of the most espressive arts i've ever seen!I love the datails and the lighting, this is so awesome! Great job!

@StaffTrollx Maybe after addition to the game if it get accepted, but not for now.
@lukinu could you do me a favor ? im trying to use this model and the saryn model you posted in vrchat. but i cant seem to export these models from unity with the textures still on them. i dont know how and ive been trying days to figure it out. i was wondering if you could make the saryn and this model into fbx files with the textures/materials embedded into them. so i can upload it here https://www.mixamo.com/#/ (this is only for person use) this website apparently lets me rig models very easily for vrchat. if you could do this i would be very greatful. every time i export the saryn model from unity and try to rig it with that website the textures arnt included.

Awesome scene! Good job!
I love it! Congrats :) Aaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle \o/
Incredible level of details and great story-telling, congrats!
Very enjoyed to rotate your scene! So much details
So much to see!
My diorama is VR ready, you can see this wit you headset :D
increíble trabajo, muy detallado diorama y muy bonita forma de contar la historia.
AWESOME! Love it!
Aunque ya te he comentado por otro lado, te comento aquí también.
Tu diorama me ha parecido uno de los mejores, lleno de detalles y con una historia muy peculiar. Cada murloc tiene su propia personalidad y se nota el esfuerzo y el cariño que has puesto. Sinceramente no entiendo como no has quedado entre los finalistas o las menciones honoríficas. Aún así, siéntete orgulloso de tu trabajo, muchos apreciamos realmente el esfuerzo y el resultado, mucho ánimo!.
@rosa.iglesias Muchas gracias por tu apoyo y compresión, también he leído tu otro comentario :) muchos artistas merecían mas reconocimiento también pero las reglas no fueron muy claras al final, le escribí al organizador del concurso pero no respondió nada mas...espero que tome en cuenta mis recomendaciones, aun así estoy muy feliz de mi trabajo por que fue algo muy personal, fue realizado con  mucho amor y mis pequeños Murlocs lo saben XD. En CG+ les gustó mucho mi trabajo y lo colocaron como ejemplo de portada, puedes subir también tus trabajos allí también, te dejo el enlace :)  https://cgplus.com/
Amazing!! Increible!! Todas esas noches sin dormir han merecido la pena, sin duda.
@kikelodeon Muchas gracias!
So cool !! :3
The level of detail... incredible. Which program was used to make this happen?
@emirtarik I Have used Maya,Zbrush and quixel suit for this. Thank you for your comment :)
very nice detailing.... *thumbs up*
Awesome. I published your work on my blog: http://www.xunulu.com/favoritos-de-sketchfab-i-inspiracion-lowpoly/

Awesome detail in the feathers rosor, though I think my favorite elements are the beak and front talons. What's the poly count running at?

There seems to be something going on with the feathers on the rump directly in front of the tail on the back. Besides that - I can't wait to see this guy animated.
@theanmator  it's still  WIP, might go over a few things to make sure all plays well. Not sure what you mean with the something going on. I would fix it but I don't get what you mean. Glad you like the design. This version has a higher polycount since I doubled the feathers planes to check the model in marmoset (no double sided option)... first. Unity doesn't have any doubled sided option yet either (big shame) and unreal does (Unreal version will be lighter)...
This version is a compromise between the griffon from ARK and the one from Dragon's Dogma with the PROTOFACTOR touch
Luv it!  And the feathers look fantastic!
I'll send you a video via email of what I'm talking about. It might be something solely in sketchfab. Either sorting error, or possibly inverted normals. Something minor I'm sure.
Ah ok I know what you mean now. It's indeed a z sorting issue. There are some planes using another transparent material which is not as harsh as the cutout one for the feathers. This material doesn't work great when viewed from sevetal angles and in front of other transparent materials... the cutout for the hair doesn't look quite right. Hard to find the right balance.... we'll see what's possible to do to improve this... maybe we'll get lucky.
GRrrrr... there is a weird hick up / glitch with this animation ... Not happening in 3ds max or marmoset... Annoying... sorry about that...
Wow,cant wait to see this one animated!
those feathers are amazing!!!! Love it
This is really smooth! I like how realistic you make it as well.

@misterfox thanks for this comment, I'm really glad you like it!
Hi, we would love to use your model on our medical wiki Flexikon (http://www.flexikon.de), where we feature already some 3D anatomy models. Is it possible to reupload it as a privat modell in our sketchfab account and ad explanation tags, when we buy it? Download we be disabled obviously.
@doccheck First of all thank you for purchasing this product!! As long as the model is private, there is no problem.

 Thanks again!

Cesar
Need to know is it a single object or with multiple parts?
As i need to use it for AR where i need to touch and drag the teeth.
As soon as my query solved ill love to buy this.

Thank you for the comments !! :D
The composition is great! Love how you incorporate the various Blender UI elements :D

Whoa, those concave eyes that follow you around. :O
Fantastic! I love the 'inside the Blender UI' setup too. Staff pick!
I've also shared it on BlenderNation: https://www.blendernation.com/2017/02/16/blender-chan/
Oh my, I love this <3
I also really like how you did the eyes!
oh wow! this is genius!
Gracias.
First time I see eyes following the viewer (except in some famous ancient paintings).
Nice nice touch! I love it
Wow! so meta! Are we real? :/
@searkitchen you should post this on the Blender Reddit - I'm sure they'd love it there!
I didn't know the dragon illusion could be used on just the eyes and work so well !
Thanks for the tip.
absolutely love it!
Her eyes follwin' me when that sexy cube right under her.
I'd kill to take her place.

Fantastic work! Giving it a Staff Pick :)
Wow! Thanks a lot =D for the staff pick. I will send all the problems i've had exporting from ZBrush.
Amazing work. I can see there's an issue in the mouth, right (I guess it's due to some kind of exporting problem)? Still, absolutely great! Keep the good work!
Just for constructive purposes; You could improve your model a lot if you lengthen her right leg (if she extended her left leg you could clearly see there is a length difference between them).
We recommended your work for this week's IA Magazine roundup:

Dear lord, I signed up for this website so I could comment and fav this project. Absolutly stunning textures and low poly modeling, I am deeply in love with this project. How many textures did you use? What sizes where they? Did you model in maya? Where did you UV? Did you paint this all in photoshop? 100% fantastic! The only thing I saw that looks a little odd, was that the culling in the pine trees seems to get confused with which tree to show in front of another if you're looking at two on top of each other. Great work!
brilliant!
Thanks for the comments!All the work was done in 3DS Max, and textured in Photoshop. There's around 30 small textures all together, which fit into a 512x512 texture space. There's a small breakdown at the end of the page here, if anyone is interested: http://www.polycount.com/forum...Haha, yeah, I had real difficulty with alpha sorting, and never managed to fully fix the issue.
Oh wow, so much to discover in this one! Nice work.
Definitely one of my favorite entries from the VG Remix. It's a whole story in itself.
This is amazing!
this is really nice
I like your style glenatron. Looking forward to see more of your stuff :)
it's really fantastic. is it game scene?
I put it in my cabinet of threedbook (https://www.threedbook.com/u/10004)

Technical curiosity: the rings of coins around the coin piles, do they serve as consealment to the borders of the piles?
so many thing to explore , nice
Your work is always great and I really appreciate the fact that you clearly know what optimisation means.

Great! However, I would like to see more detail, like a security guard outfit on the guy, and the animatronics.
If fpossible, that is.
I would but the person wasnt soposed to be their and I cannot add the animatronics unless i6nis lets me
This is very good. Well done!
Well then more model for the rooms themselves would be nice.
you picked from skcthup the same textures erros and the person in the office...
ate q ficou legal
you can add his animatronics, seeing ass you took the heads of them and put them backstage + foxys endoskeleton
I could but not without the permission of i6nis
valeu seu filha da puta  do meu coração te amo :3
i want to use this for the show stage
thx bro i really like this model!
^_^
question: are you thinking about doing the second game's pizzeria too, or are you going to stay and update this one first?
@wariorules i allready started it its not that good but i will release it anyway but in future ill upload the finished version
this is shit btw http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/Deal_With_It91.jpg
why is there a toy animatronic pices box in backstage
@chica the chicken well they had to be somewhere during fnaf1
Too glitchy
BTW, try exporting in Collada (.dae) instead of .obj. This may resolve the glitchy texture issues, but I may be wrong. Just give it a shot and let me know!
the toy animatronics box was in fnaf3 only
Ok I'll take box out but the safe room stays

There is no plan to sell yet.

Wireframe's too clean to have been made in ZBrush (ZRemesher). I'd say it's a manual retopo done in Maya or 3D-Coat. Really amazing looking reworked scan.
@ten24 looks fabulous even static :) thanks for sharing!
@ten24 ps: i'd just maybe recenter the rotation axis?

Do you have a way to show this area and include lat 39.43768,   lan - 121.503060 ?

Trying to determine if it is necessary to evacuate, elevation here is approx 420 ft. which is safe from a rise of the river but unknown if a wall of water would reach this location during catastrophic dam failure. 

Thank you
@cnn yes I can. The resolution of image and terrain will bes lower due to the limits of 3d models in sketchfab, but It is possible. Even with a overlay about the flooding prediction I saw here:https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/ddb8b9aa-4257-448a-a230-e2596b6c65f9-original.jpeg

Big thanks!

This model was proper for my school task.
The model is fine, a gift from above.  But there is no texture available. It refers to a psd file, but better be it a png. And there is no material, no UV channel. You will have to paint the texture yourselves. Alternatively you could rip the texture from the preview on this site, if you check the browser console and get the png file. But still you will have to unwrap yourselves.
You are to blame for my newly found obsession of blender. ^_^
Thank  you, im gonna put you in the creditis :3

i'm trying to make the real thing and i don't know the words by any chance could you please email them to me @ hannah.zeman@me.com
Loved it and will be using it on my avatar for VRChat I will glady send you a picture.
Is there any way you can send me an email with that is written on the bat. I'm having issues reading it and I love this one a lot better than most that I have seen.

Wish I could download it, I would simulate spinning it like a top to see what kind of patterns emerge.
Interesting that it is decorated on only three 'sides' that would suggest to me that the item is designed to be orientated in one way, perhaps mounted in something?

Hopefully we'll improve dithering on our side, to reduce the flickering (while moving).

I noticed some lights (and shadows) are still attached on the camera, is it on purpose?
Shadows attached on the camera are more expensive that static ones.

Awesome model, thanks for sharing. We have a 3D data set from UMBC campus from an aerial scan some 10 years ago.  I will try to find and post on Sketchfab also so you can compare.  It was pretty rough back then.

Nice work, Stephen!By the way, we've fixed the problem with georeferenecd models export (these unwanted convulsions of the models) in PhotoScan 1.0.2 (available for download already).
Very nice. What camera did you use?
Was the pictures shot as Auto mission? How did you define this mission.
Dear Aerialtasts,
I used a Canon ELPH 520 HS with the trigger depressed by velcro.  For more info check out:

if you can put that in a ukx/upk, for ue2/ udk or ue3, regardless, with a full mesh (not modular)

rigged to an animation (that's a big deal, and i can swap animations if it's UNREAL ENGINE COMPATIBLE for UE2/UE3.
i have no full animation set for unreal engine 4

and before you say it can't be done, peek this: youtube.com/watch?v=9KldcFJViHU
i know very well what can and can't be done, cuz i'm doing stuff and so far, any non modular mesh can fit into the engine i am using (ue1)

but it at least has to be in a UNREAL 1, 2 or 3 file (.ukx, or upk) and non modular, but boned/rigged and i'll pay you substantially more than what you are wanting.
and yes i'd prefer ue3/udk process, but i know ue2 would be simpler and just as good, if you are looking to turn quick dollars, i'm the guy you want to please.
nice work btw. and yes i expect to lose the physics hair, during the process of putting it into udk/ue3/ue2 which ever you choose.

as long as you make it compatible with bipedfemalea(or ac) or K_AnimHuman_BaseMale

if you need the animations, i'll gladly supply them so you can rig/bone models that are compatible for either one.

and of course, if you can pull off the simple task of swapping the animations, i'll add a decent bonus ontop of the asking price. 

hopefully we can do business soon/in the future.

Welcome back Mike :) Could you add the #blender tag so I can include this in Monday's overview on BlenderNation?
I've just featured you on BlenderNation!

Enjoy :)
Nice model, man! So cute!
would love to port it into garrys mod
Id love to put this in my VR game orbiting Mars since Musk wants to launch a roadster up there. If you have one of the new Roadster that would be even better. I have no problem giving you credit! Beautiful model. Please message me. Damosdesigns@ gmail.com
Hi, I plan to build a mobile app using Unity to display vehicle information from the Tesla API overlayed on the vehicle. I'd love to use this model if you are open to it. I'd credit you in the project, of course!

I LOVE this! One of my favorite animations so far...
Beautiful!
So great!!
Cool!:D
Congrats! We put your work to be featured by ItsArt Mag this week: http://www.itsartmag.com/features/sketchfab-realtime-models-selection-30/
Thank you guys. I had a great time working on this one.
I also discovered how it can be tricky to export rotating objects which are not aligned with the main axis.
The gears inside the globe were quite a pain in the ass to animate properly. 
Fortunately, nothing I couldn't handle.

Congrats on the animation function. It works like a charm !
Nice! I didn't know you could put animations in Sketchfab!
@robindao it's still in beta, check it out: http://sketchfab.com/animation
My first steps here.....Wonderful jobs.
Congratulations.
Really creative idea and an equally great realization! Instantly became one of my most favorite models on Sketchfab :D
Perfect!

Thank you for upload.

Sorry, but after introducing animation on sketchfab other models seem to be static...
Wow...just wow, the lighting and shader work on this is just sublime
Nice !
Wow, very cool!
nice
Thanks again for your support guys. :)
Wonderful. Cool.
Congratulations, you were just featured on CG Channel!

http://www.cgchannel.com/2015/08/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-august-2015/
@bartv  , very cool ! I really liked the other models they selected.

Thanks @carlosfilo
WOW 
Perfect
Wow! Great!!
Wow ! Très, très gentil, grand.
wow, amazing! How did you do the animation?
Adding to my question: sketchfab normally only accepts fbx files. And they are depended on bones. This doesn't look like a bone dependent animation but more one you use empties for.

Awesome work.  Did you record yourself making it?
looks good, great work.
thanks looks good, great work.
The fact the whole undercarriage is modeled and textured is just unbelievable.
Phenomenal work! If you don't mind me asking...are you transferring these details from a high poly model or doing this all with texture painting? That poly count is impressive.
I guess what I'm asking is...do you start with a high poly subdivided model or a sculpt?

You can fix the mirroring issue on the posters, the missing bear <3

I just love this scene, but there are more into it, which I really like. The building design, the colors and the total city design.

I invite you to eventually cooperation with Nordsted Design. Please contact me if interested.

Time to give this one the Staff Pick it deserves. I keep coming back to it again and again in VR!
This is really beautiful.

Looks like you might want to increase the mask threshold just a little bit on one of the materials to get rid of the white edges on the orange trees.
@james  Yeah you're right, nice find :)
This is really impressive and so intriguing.
we need walking simulator features on sketchfab :)
@endike yes we do! :D

Cool!  How is Hope? :-)
@KunsthistorischesMuseumWien not as much as you would think :) 

- taking the photos took maybe 30minutes (there were hundreds of people in the space but they have been miraclously removed!)
- alignment using @CapturingReality took half an hour or so
- processing to higher detail took 4 - 5 hours
- decimation, texturing, upload, annotations etc. took another couple of hours

@miekeroth Hope is awesome in person! She says hi :D ?
That's spectacular Thomas. Great model.  Think I'll take this as inspiration to try and reprocess an old SfM image set (850 images) of Furness Abbey museum from 2008.
thanks @rockrich - sounds like an intersting plan, I'd love to see the results. Do you know about our current 3D scanning challenge? You might like to enter with your resulting model :) More info:
https://blog.sketchfab.com/sketchfab-3d-scanning-challenge-interiors/
@nebulousflynn  Be worth seeing whether early Photosynth efforts work. The challenge looks interesting.
Just added to my collection of some of my favorite models on @Sketchfab! Brilliant.
Also: staff pick :)
Isn't there a Coelacanth between 10 and 11? It's been a while since I was there but I remember very fondly when I saw it there for the first time. What a museum. Good scan, though it would be nice if there was an added pass for each of the specimens so they'd be a little more detailed.
Amazing scan, and really interesting stuff.
@nebulousflynn  Amazing this is where I work. 
Sorry I havent been in touch since we met. This image is so very inspiring I must get busy now myself.
Much nicer like that than in point cloud (and easier to load too) !
@kongle the NHM recently renovated the gallery completely: http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/galleries-and-museum-map/hintze-hall.html. If I had more time I'd love to capture the space in more detail.

@Ivanix88 thanks!

@bigshineybike glad it has inspired you :) I'll be giving a short Sketchfab workshop at the Museum next month, would be happy to meet in the afternoon if you have time?

@gerpho sometimes I like the point cloud more but agree that optimised meshes display a lot easier (especially on mobile etc.)
Super !!
thanks @paul3uk :)
Wow ! Great model :)
thanks @digitage - not bad for half an hour in a museum full of public visitors :)
Very nice! I'd like to know how you took the photos: what trajectories and directions did you shoot? I've been struggling to scan interior spaces.
Wow, I particularly like putting on a headset and standing on the whale's spine!
hey @filipeg - I've added 3 images to the description showing camera positions in RealityCapture. Basically I moved around the hall grabbing batches of 6 or so shots at different angles / elevations.

@ancientartarchive awesome - I've not tried it myself, sounds like fun :D
@nebulousflynn That's exactly what I needed to know! Thanks for adding this information. :)
China NO.1
Hey Sir, It's GREAT! How to download it?
hi @Jing.Du - thanks for your kind words. This model is not currently available for download.

Amazing as usual! really impressive how you can put so much detail and keep the model around 100.K faces!
Fantastic, I think that's the first time I've seen someone use animation tracks to change a scene. I'm giving it a staff pick!

PS: I made the explanation in your description bold to people won't miss it :)

@asideofchidori Yay! Thank you very much! I use a normal map for body and swimwear.

very nice ! Thanks
We also love this model Daniel, Please confirm that it's ok if we use it :)

Thanks again!
@foxdie491 You may use it.
@Daniel Do you have a .3ds model of one of the dome shield generators on top? I am making a shield mod for a game called Space Engineers and I am trying to update the models for my mod - this would be very useful! Thanks in advance,
Alex
@4c3 I could easily fix it. Where can i send it?
@DanielAndersson Thanks a lot! My email is skimpilot@gmail.com. I will send you the mod link afterwards. Remember I only need the Shield generators.
@DanielAndersson This looks really good. I heard making a model like this is quite a lot of work. How much does a Star Destroyer like this cost? (How much you guys normally sell one of these for?)
@Krazedito Thank you! It is quite a lot of work, but this has just been an interest on the side for me. I'm giving away all my models for free here and on Blendswap. I'm not sure if it's legal to sell models of copyrighted materials, but I know a lot of people do that. When it comes to my models, I've gone through a couple of iterations of each, doing some tweaking. So it's hard to say how much time it has taken, but maybe around 15-20 hours for a totally new model, but a lot less for variations (like TIE). I also try and reuse a lot of parts to make it faster.
@DanielAndersson oh ok
This is quite an amazing model. I am working on a X-wing simulator (personal use) and would love to use this model in my game.
@goliath520 Thanks, feel free to use any of my models. If you ever do anything with it, I'd love to see.
@DanielAndersson Not doing it justice quite yet but this is an amazing piece of work. You can see bits and pieces of my project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjytbc460pk
@goliath520 That looks great! Very cool with multiple monitors! I've tried doing an X-Wing game too. Did a lot of work on the explosions and breaking up of ships, but got stuck on the AI. Looking forward to seeing how it goes for you :)

Hello, i have problem with this model i opened it in blender 2.79 and several errors showed up. It says materials.blend are missing.
Do you know how to fix it?
@Mithrall I will take a look at it. Thanks for letting me know!
@Mithrall Did a quick fix. Check if it works better now.
It's better, yet not perfect 'ReflectiveGlass' and 'Light' are missing and cannot find and open 'Base'.

Hey @sebasfig, it looks like you re-uploaded your model and broke your textures?
@mrbones I think he has been sentenced to an endless journey with no destination, but voilà, he's landed in Sketchfab!
Heads-up: you were featured in a Sketchfab blogpost that was featured by World of Warcraft on Twitter! *awesome*

The OBJ format doesn't work very well in Maya, you will have to reconnect some of the textures by hand. Or, Download it from my site http://joel3d.com/TrexModelByJoel3d.zip
Fantastic
Outstanding !! Great for a certain grandson...Thanks
@rdeg That's great to hear, Thanks!
Quitte detailed and very good! Thanks!
This model is incredible, especially the detail in the teeth and eyes..
Thanks! That means a lot - each time I open it it displays differently.  It seems to be missing textures?
The textures always appear when I view it, although there is sometimes a delay in loading the textures on a web browser. Again, great job.
Hey, we recommended your model to be featured on 3D Printing Industry! Congratulations :) See the article here: http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/06/19/free-3d-printable-of-the-week-10-game-characters/
Very, very nicely done...thanks for sharing!!
Thanks for sharing your amazing T-Rex model..................you did a great job....checked your site and was like WOW........(*bookmarked)

Love this. Great pose. Love those sparks. Staff Pick!
Thought you'd like to know that we loved this guy so much we featured him on our social media this week!
@paulchambers3d  Thanks a bunch! Sorry, I just saw it today, haven't checked my notifications in a while :)
Really good composition and quality (for a low poly).
Though there's one thing wrong with it considering the situation. His hammer shouldn't be as cold. After all, considering the sparkles, he just hit the heated metal with it. Considering that such smiting techniques requires metal to be heated at 400+ degrees, the heat does affect the hammer's structure and should light its surface for a short time after each strikes. The color of the hammer is actually one of the old ways of timing each strike and make sure the smiting hammer doesn't get damaged too early. (If you strike too soon, the hammer gets damaged... if you strike too late, the metal gets too cold.)

Just a tiny thing that caught my eye. Great job either way!
Awesome model
Wow. Loving this.
Eea! Might a speal!)))
Ultimate coolness!
@hexonian Indeed!
Amazing! Try to animate that. Realy Awesome :)
As a casual blacksmith, I thank you.
I really like the style of this. I am in the process of making a game and need a model just like this. Looks really great.
Amazing.
Beautiful!
Amazing work, thanks for creating this.
Astonishing
Wonderfull job...
I think he shouldn't have that shoulder armour, apart from that, great job!
You're doing great!
Well done, I like his stylized form.
Many thanks, it is actually under treatment for a  full color 3D print.
Olmopotums I absolutely love this model and would like to use it in my company logo...
Would you approve?

Building Minecraft castles is a guilty pleasure of mine. The detailing is phenomenal. Your textures seem a bit different than typical Minecraft textures (purposefully more pixellated). Are you using a modded skin or is it a result of the extra work in ZBrush/3ds Max? The custom lighting is a really great touch.
Thanks! I have to separate all the blocks uv to bake lighting map and AO map. As a result, even with a large 4096 res texture map, each block only has about 4 x 4 area. Fortunately, the low res style works well with minecraft build :)

I spent a long time building this castle, adding as much detail as possible. But due to the 50 mb file size restirction, I have to remove a lot of the decorations :(
Super cool. Congrats on the Staff Pick!

You'll have to try to win a Pro account in one of the contests to increase your file size limit ;)
Thanks :)
I've added download link for the map file, you can check it out ingame if interested.
Awesome, thanks for sharing!

Looking forward to exploring it.
Wow! I found a smiling pillar in the basement! What his story?
I added the secret chamber just for fun after finished building the castle, it holds the base of the castle beacon. There's a simple combination lock for the chamber door. I suggest you check out the map ingame to see the full effect.
Forgot to mention, you can access the chamber by going down the spiral staircase at the south-east corner, and you need to pull down three specific levers of the combination lock to open the chamber door.
This is incredible... I can't wait to have hotspots and annotations ready on Sketchfab, so that you can setup a tour inside the castle!
Nice! looking forward for the feature :)
crazy
Even better with annotations!
Looks great with that baked lighting!
Impressive
Amazing work and visuals.
Howdy, your model is featured on It's Art Magazine this week too!. Have a great weekend!

Friend I believe you out did yourself on this
No mtl file?
@iulius890 Sorry, most of these early uploads have texture uploaded manually, which sketchfab doesn't pack together when you download it. And I'm too lazy to reupload these files :P

So you might have to download the minecraft map file from the description and apply the textures yourself if you want to use it somewhere else.
@iulius890 Nevermind, I've fount the original texture file, it's only uses one texturemap. Here's the download link: http://www.mediafire.com/view/xmjyktxe6svycq4/

EDIT: i just went through my facebool log and i think i know why xD! Heroes of the storm has freaking shared your work!? Thats amazing man keep up the good work and i would love if you  would put up tutorials and such how you did em! 

Studying to become a game artist so it would really help with some extra tips from someone who know what he's doing!
They did! Here's the link for reference :)

Bart: Thank you for the link

katlamuu: You can email me and I will send you some tutorials I like! I don't think I am quite at the point where I should be making tutorials, but thank you for the kind words (:  kmactastic@gmail.com

I would like to download it!
why isn't it downloadable
I just made all our models downloadable. Enjoy!!
is it just my computer or is his sword missing?
You were featured on It's Art, congratulations :)

http://www.itsartmag.com/features/sketchfab-turntable-models-selection-18/
it look nice, but my computer is so slow that I can't view the models right. i downloaded the model but it be nice if it was t-pose and have texture files. by the way projectmgame, what texture resolution did you use (for exmaple: ???x???).
where can  statrted to make my own design?
Awesome model! I never finished the Ocarina of Time but the story is good!
i am a fan of the legend of zelda and this is truly a work of art
by the way my name is not jake
lol
Could you give me a few tips on how you made him, I really want to know. This is so awesome! I love the legend of zelda games!
Thank you for project!!! I'll try make a papercraft model from it!
there are no textures
did you model this or rip it? Either way looks great!
wow amazing good job
Hey do you have a T-pose version of this model? Because I want to rig and animate this model for a college project along with your Armored Charizard and its kinda hard to rig them when they are not in a T-pose. All credit will go to you of course for the models.
hey what software/app do i have to use to get the textures to work?
aka the best Link
@gemmagalea you have to its amazing
omg a T-pose would be so insane
@byNici yes. i would love to use this model for a demo combat test

Just tried it. Its awesomeness lies in its simplicity :)
Damn, you beat me XD. We need toggleable layers so we can stick different phones in there :D
Is this to scale? Like could it be 3d printed? If so are you willing to share? My cardboard is already starting to wear out from everyone playing with it but we have a 3d printer and I would love you forever if I could print a plastic version to put the lenses in.
how do you render the model with materials?  When I upload my models I can only render them as shaded colors.
@dan325013 : go on settings > 3D settings here you can set all your material (texture and everything) and other settings (view, background...)
@digitalfiz : you can already download the template here : https://developers.google.com/cardboard/ .  it will be a waste of time and money to print it in 3D when a simple cardboard do the job.
Looks great with annotations!
Now , you can get full kit $9.98

Lovely model. But it appears to be missing the nose bridge divider section? The slots are there for it. This is the piece that stops your eyes from seeing the wrong part of the display screen.

love this. Great hand painting!!

Great use of light and shadow! Almost looks like it's moving. 
My favorite character in the game. :)
Amazing!
This is fantastic ? props for adding the soundtrack. What software did you use to paint the textures?
Amazing job, I've never seen another conversion that looked as legitimate as this! They should hire you.
@emiliestabell Thanx Emilie, for this one I painted it in Zbrush and polished it in photoshop!
You have create a piece of art, could make downloadable, pleaseeeeeee, so i can print
This is so good, i love Hornet as a character, outstanding work :D Also i love how dense the geometry on the thread is :P 
On other note, does Zbrush generate that kind of low poly on its own, or did you make it yourself?
@MZSurprise Glad you like it! On this one I was a little more lazy with the topology, just focused on the texture painting. For the main body I used the automatic Zbrush remesher but made some small stuff by hand.

May I ask, do you textured this in blender?
@dwcrew Thanks :)
yes, all textures was made in Blender.
@dennish2010 Amazing! I'm using SP but I can never achieve such detail on my models
Nice model, though for realism on the animation you may want to try animating the hammer on the gun as well.
Also, since it's a 1911, that trigger pull should be straight back, not tilting rearward, just a tip.
Great texture work!
Cool, you should add the empty shell ejecting from the breech to top it off :D
@danielc02 Agree, I just was too lazy to animate a empty shell, I will add one if I find time.
Nice one!
At you very good job !
Very cool!
Very nice dude
Uh oh! We can't reload it! (There's not reload preview animation... lol) Oh, wait... What if we press F5?
That's not how the trigger on the M1911 works, it moves horizontally backwards when you press it... Some call it ergonomic others don't like it. But besides that the model is great!

@ph34r I know it, and that's too bad. I hope SE will do something soon! I'm waiting for this friday to play it :)
I really like how you can see under his skirt, how much work is there to download ?
how can i download dis model?
@Lee_Sin @thulio555 i'm seriously thinking on selling my models for 3d printing, because the download requesters. Would you buy it if it's not too much expensive?
Congratulations!, nice work!
The noodle fingers kill it for me.

O love all of your works! Every time I see a new model of yours it leaves me in awe ;)
Wow, very strong animations and great use of the different animation tracks too! It's another staff pick for you :)
Brilliant!!!!
@distance880 Thank you :) I just wanted to keep it simple :)
@comatos @vlbehrens @sarah.sobieski @ieva_lickiene @santell Thank you all :) I'm glad you like it !
@bartv Thank you :) the trick was to have the same start and end pose (sphere-pose) for each animation to get everything loopable. BTW I had to upload the file as FBX 6.1 ASCII to get all animations work.First I tried to upload the blend file but I only get the default track.

Another great one!

Might be nice to rename the animations, even if it's just in the Sketchfab editor, to make the list a bit more readable :)
@paulchambers3d xD this video inspired me a bit

@penguinburger1 Thanks :)
@amirjaved135 do you find my license unfair? You can still use it for non commercial project and if plan to use it for commercial projects than just contact me :)
https://3dartdh.wordpress.com/contact/
@james Thanks you :) Your right, I didn't know that renaming the animations is possible, cool! I will rename the animations immediately :)
Thanks for that, absolutely wonderful
is there a commercial license I can buy for this?
@theonlytrandana Hello and yes, there is a version for commercial use.
I just added a link to the description.
EPIC!
Super :D !

Great model, but also great lighting and perfect use of the DOF effect.

@seori Wow, that's cool! Thank you =)
epic.
How did you possibly capture that much detail with such low poly :O
I am honestly blown away!
Is there a way to download this model?
@K1TT3N Thank you!
@dactilardesign Thanks!
@YautjaLord just made it downloadable.
null
@henriquedw   Thank you for making available for download. I do have a question, how did you get the model to look so detailed and crisp? I'm using 3ds Max and cannot replicate how it looks in the 3D preview. Any suggestions and tips?

Thank you
@YautjaLord Hello! I would have to look at your scene to answer to know, that are many factors. Part of it could be the post-processing in the sketchfab scene which has some sharpening, probably.
@henriquedw is there a way I can show you my scene? I do apologize for the constant questions.
@YautjaLord just out of curiousity what are you modeling? also have you created a normal map or bump map for details?
@willphase1 I am applying the provided .pngs from this model. I am using the bump map for details.
@YautjaLord if it is still not looking accurate it is probably because you are using the 3D max default viewer which simply wont look nearly as good as a dedicated PBR renderer like Sketchfab, Marmoset, or the Substance Painter renderer. I think maya has a decent viewer as well but as far as i know Max doesn't have anything that sophisticated.

lol everything is great but that hole in the neck just bugs me. I am impressed that he moves so well when the meshes is chopped up into pieces. Im just curious why you chose to do it that way cuz s long as it works then it works and your model man, works
@dutchallians He can barely reach it! Mehehe
@ybourykina Thanks! :D
@zugzug Thanks!!
@stephomi woohoow!
@lawlordp It's actually not chopped up enough haha. Aslong as it doesn't give problems, it is totally fine to do that and save polys. In fact, I've been told by a few people I shouldn't have modeled that many things in one piece.
Love it!!
Awesome work! Digging the textures.
Awesome work!

Is the model available in obj format?
@Robmarel Not right now, but we'll eventually be uploading OBJ/STL versions of the full skull model as well as of the individual bones.
fantastic
How can we download this model in OBJ format with all the sub-bones in sub-meshes?
@Robmarel For the time being, you'll have to download the FBX and export OBJ's from something like Maya or 3DS.
Quiet stunning piece! Highly appreciated
This is incredible, well done and thank you for the download!
This is amazing, well done and good work
@witmerlab Great model and resource! Any idea when the individual bones will be available for download?
Is there anyway to purchase this model for commercial use? I have a client that wants educational renderings for classroom purposes.
good job

This is incredible, just out of curiosity what is the personal projects. A game, animation, or something else?
@dhakerey , Thanks :D

@DGMworks , Thank you ! , This for game :D
@arnoldrui , That's cool I'm also trying to make my own game. Though I don't have much practice on modeling characters, do you have any tips?
@DGMworks do you mean about making the character ? , i think you need to study first the human anatomy and study topology by seeing others 3D models topology. after that you need to pratice making your own character base on what u learn from it. i think after that you will get you own workflow and topology by itself :D.
I've featured you on BlenderNation, enjoy :-)

@bartv Owaahh Thanks you bart :D
Wow, awesome work! Really great model! 
So what type of game are you making with her?

I would also love to use the model for my personal projects, but that's probably not happening :)
@fleshmobproductions  an action RPG game. hmm what game you want to make with my model ? maybe we can do a collaboration :)
@arnoldrui Thanks for the reply! I am making a fighting game that has similarities to Super Smash Bros. I'll send you a link to the gameplay when the game is in a presentable state. But it can take a few more months. 

And good luck for your game :)
@fleshmobproductions  isee, the idea sound good i like fighting games like super smash bros too and i would like to see the games if it has been at a presentable state :). and if you want i can share the model with you if you need it to be in your game i would love to see my model on action in the game haha XD. just sent me an email of what my model will be used in your game :D. and sorry for my bad english T.T

Good luck for your game project too :) !.
Thanks! Really great to hear such a positive response! I do not need the model right now, I will design and code proper game mechanics and implement my first character before I will include another character. But I would love to have models with an artstyle similar to this model in my game, really great modelling for an anime design. 
About including your character: we would have to design a moveset and a set of attacks for the game. Then the model has to be animated. That will take a lot of time and effort. And someday in the future I hope I can release my game commercially for a few bucks and we would need a proper written agreement on the use of the model in the game. 

I'll update you if I have made decent progress on my game and we can continue the conversation then if you are still interested by then :)
@Rui  
Hi, Rui, thank you for sharing your perfect model! It is really amazing! 
May I ask some questions here? Is this model made by Blender?
And I wander if I could buy the model from you here? 
Thank you!
@ShFQiu  hi shfQiu  Thank you i'm glad to hear that ! , yes this models made by blender. unfortunately  i doesn't have a permision to seeling it with the sketchfab store.and it will possible to buy it i have thinking of this lately because of alot of people want the model so i think i will put this model to other platform like CGtrader or something.


@fleshmobproductions looking forward for it :D.
@Rui

Hi again, I realized that you are offering to sell the model now. Can we expect that you include a rigged version of the model? If so, I'm certainly gonna buy it. 

Nevertheless, I can still send you information about my game and possible plans on how to implement your character in the future if you're interested!
@Rui

do you have a version of the model weightpainted and rigged or nu
@ofinalfantasyoxiii Hi , this model itself has been rigged but without any animation. is has been humanoid rigged for posing annd animating.  with the swword and the sword handles separate.
@arnoldrui if i buy it right now could i use it in vr chat is it weight painted fully ready to go like vr ready?
so is it Vr ready if i wanted to use it in vr chat i animate in the guy in unity and i love to use her for my blade mage
@ofinalfantasyoxiii yes it is fully weight paint to the body so that's why i can pose it for the sketchfab. you can totally make any pose you want or animate it as you want in the unity or any 3d software. :)

Cool!
how did you create this animation? fbx does not export morphs. what program did you use?
incredible model!!! i haven't looked through all of the structures but your superior vena cava is incorrectly labeled at the ascending side of the aortic arch. the SVC is the vessel more posterior, looking like its embedded in the back of the heart tissue and connected to the vessel below the tissue directly vertical to it.
@sdegli Thanks, that has been modified.
i need it for my project please how can i get it
this ,po
@intervoke @intervoke hi sir can you please give this model to me I'm very need it for my gradution project and i cant afford its cost plz
48 hour sale: This available for sale and download for a limited time!
Impressive work,how long will it available for download again?
there are few questions i wanted to ask.

1. how did you add annotation on a model plz guide
2. how can i get this model?
Why did you put it for sale just 48 hours. Ive discovered this today it would be perfect for the AR app I'm doing for medicine students. PLease tell me there's another way of getting it. If so which would be the cost? Both the modeling and the animation are fucking great.
wow! very impressive work!
How can I get this model?
could you provide with oxygen flow this model
and what's price of this animated model

Lovely, the colors & crookedness are just perfect! I personally would make the window (when seen from the outside) a little darker, as it is very bright now and attracts more attention than the room
@cotman_sam Hey! Thank you for the feedback! I changed the window texture to be less bright, now it's much better ^^
The atmosphere of this scene is amazing, so cozy and safe ! Great job !
@homomilk Thank you!! ^^
You've made 2nd place in our Isometric Room challenge, congratulations!

https://blog.sketchfab.com/sketchfab-low-poly-challenge-isometric-room/
There's a lot to see in this room but it never feels like 'too much'. I really like the foreground details, and the small references are a great touch (I still don't think I've spotted everything)!
The colours and the light are beautiful, love the see through wall with the Door and windows! Reminds me of a stylized Ikea room :D
congrats on the Honourable mention! 
well deserved!
very good!! congrats!!
This has wonderful detail :D ...totally didnt spend a good five minutes just looking at the all the tiny details, video game boxes and sticky notes at alllllllllllll :p
@bartv @gav.grant @makostrike @chaitanyak @curlscurly @nomadking  Thank you all, and thanks for the second place in the contest! I had a lot of fun designing all the details!
Very neat
Nice work
Check my isometric model please https://sketchfab.com/models/77e47f28419140b9beba33ac456fde12
@blackspire Is the lighting in this scene baked or is this hand painted?
this is awesome
very nice!
SWEET!
Wow, you've reached 2000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

This is way too good. If you change the shading to default (lit) and then hold the Alt key and rotate the view with the mouse button (to rotate the environmental lighting), it creates a kind of time lapse shadow study effect. Very interesting feature.
Fantastic!
Thanks, @charlie12 !
Really enjoyed this one. It will help my students understand modeling only what is needed- even in a seemingly very complex situation.

Dude, i checked out your app, and that is a great idea!!! looks fucking awesome! keep it up!
great model, unfortunately the texture on the building on the right seems to be missing!
anywhere i can find it, thanks!!
I was able to good video thanks to your wonderful model. Thanks.
https://youtu.be/LBIMlTwLNdI
Does anyone know why Unity 5.4.0 chokes on this model? When I drag it into the scene, all of the texture assignments are gone. It's not simply a matter of redoing them; after setting the tmaps the model is still not correct.
A lot to learn from, thank you Mr.
@blusun You are welcome :-)
WOW NICE THANKS

Really cool :)
hermoso hermoso hermoso !!!
this is ART
This is great.
Sorry for the stupid question, but you have meshes called girl_base and girl_shell — what is shell? is it something to do with cel shading?
@colorfulfool Not a stupid question! :) To create the outline effect, I duplicate the original model and make it uniformly slightly larger -- this larger model is the shell. Then I reverse the normals on the shell and turn on backface culling in my 3d program. This gives the outline effect because the shell is only visible where it does not overlap the base model. The original model is painted with the character colors and the shell model is painted with the outline colors.
@val.ociraptor Ah, clever. Thanks.
this is amazing
is there any keywords for this modelling style?
@frontliner36 cel shaded, toon shaded, flat shaded, etc.
@val.ociraptor Thanks,
absolutely love the cartoon style and textures!

@ostapblendercg it is now!
Hi. Awesome model, I'd like to use it in my school project. After importing into Unity, it shows a warning that LOD naming is inconsistent (doesnt matter), but the LOD1 model is all glass-like, materials don't get recognized or something. https://imgur.com/a/HWltisC Could you please check this for me?
epic crack recreated

@houkouha I'm sorry. Probably the embedded material is not exported correctly from blender. Please do “Extract Materials” on Unity and adjust the material.
@wowki I just realised that getting the wheel base and track width ratios right might be a bit more tricky ;-)

Dude, you cant tell it fits in game engines. It has almost 80k vertices. That doesnt make sence. Grass for Game engines has about 1k vertices. 
But for renders I totally agree. Btw it looks good.
@leMstrx hi, it depends on use case... you can always separate one chunk (its there near the big chunk) or use texture for building your own plants... ?
Supercool!
soooo real bro that is cool
Nice

HOW TO DOWNLOAD MODEL
@janak856

This model is not for download.
What do you want to do with it?
@janak856 
If you are still interested you can purchase the model here:
https://gumroad.com/products/OALlX/edit#
@mschanz The link doesn't seem to work?
@mschanz ah, nvm. I got rid of the 'edit#'

The correct link is just 
https://gumroad.com/products/OALlX
@jx Tahnk you very much! changed the link
Perfect ! ! ! !
I like the eyes moving when you zoom in on them and move the model.
@RexGaming You like it? it is not intended. It comes from the newly implemented refraction effect for transparent objects.
@mschanz Yeah and the entire model is awesome too.
Awesome model!
I would love to see a version with feathers.
how can i see how many people have bought this?
Hi, may I know where is the T-pose is?

That's some wizardry, this is. Awesome. :-)

@fzglinski Akcent musi by? :)
I love your style

this is brilliant. i love the feel of your style. I would be very interested to hear how you textured all of these pieces? is it purely handpainted onto the uv unwrap? did you use any AO and if so what kind of lighting setup did you use?
@tzeshi No baked light/AO. All handpainted.
Wait, what? I was sure all Your textures are AO-based, respect! 

Coby wszyscy zrozumieli :P To jak to widzisz ten pomara?czowy akcent - bohater i aktywne elementy?
Anyway, in the future less unique locations will have to be baked lights in engine, because too much time I spend with hand painting. This scene took me about 12 hours, and is still far from ideal. 
@fzglinski Raczej tylko bohater i kubek. Mam nawet pomys? na twist z tym kubkiem ;)
excellent!
well the time and effort certainly paid off for these pieces. Bravo! 

So are they hand painted flat in Photoshop or on model in ZBrush/Mudbox/Substance etc? Sorry for all the questions, but I really dig your style, its blowing my mind and I must know how you do it!
@tzeshi All done in modo. I only added kitchen tiles in photoshop :)
You got featured on It's Art Magazine!

http://www.itsartmag.com/features/sketchfab-realtime-turntable-models-selection-10/
Your style is so unique and fresh. i love it! <3
may I ask your general process for painting your models? Photoshop? Or do you paint it in a 3d program?
@jx As I wrote below, all done in modo painting tools. I only added kitchen tiles in photoshop.

Thanks for making such influential art. I personally hope to see more from you soon!
You have so much style that it blows my mind to bits, dude. No fair. I love your work.
This is not a style - but a revelation... I love it!!!
awesome style
Great mood!  I also like the way you control the presentation with the closed in exterior.  Well done!

Dude, teach me!
I like the hair. Small thing, but adds so much.

Love the fingerprints
can you upload textures?
It looks cute!
Thanks everyone for your likes!

As i see, to let people download model with textures, i have to upload them in one initial package?

I'll research that furhter later, and let you know if it so. And then re-upload package.
It looks very cool. Reminds me of a pseudo-futuristic style, kind of like Perfect Dark. Love the little bit of chromatic abberation too :D
Good rendering!
Link to my site for texture download. (free and without registration ;)
http://maddesperado.wix.com/reijin#!sketchfab-3d/bpfiz
You can re-upload the package as a ZIP file that contains all the files. Sketchfab works nicely with ZIPs and all files included in the archive are then up for download.
great job and thx for sharing :)
Do you have high poly tri count
@williamch15 About 60k, smoothed to 3.6mil
Thank you I am just getting started with my 3d printer do you have a AR 15 lower reciever program if so I would like to have it too again thanks great job
how did you make the normals for the grippy part of the plastic?
@skaveria Those are most probably a noise texture with displacment
Very Nice
Wow, great model, love the small details!
Fantastic!

looks nice
Much as gracias

what program did u use to create the subnautica things
beautiful monster!
Awesome! These things are horrifying in the game.

You know what would be cool in the game would be something like a Japanese spider crab, of course with your own little Subnautica-like touches, Only make it like, 2/4 or 3/4 the size of the Aurora. I LOVE seeing huge sea creatures in this game, that's why the reefbacks are my favorites. -w- I already know about the crabsquid, he's pretty cute, but I'd love to see something...huge.

Of course, it's just a recommendation, I can imagine large creatures are very hard to program and such, so...just a thought! XD Sorry for the super long comment. :3
For some reason, I feel like this is a wayyy older model,

I really like the creature design but...


it just seems like the colors are faded, and the model doesn't really seem.. appealing I guess you could say.

Still better than anything I could do, it's a great model.
I agree but maybe its a prototype
I like how you put a city skyline as the reflection in his eyes...a terrifying premonition for the future of Subanutica's colonists?

Wow! Thank you so much Michael! That is awesome!
Hey, the awnser might be a little obvious for alot of people. How did you make a material and texture mix? Overwatch does it and I cannot figure it out. Thanks! :D Great model
I used a mixture of mudbox and Substance painter to create the maps. If you are asking technique, well I have been trying to replicate the Overwatch look too, and it's just a modified Physically based rendering pipeline with blizzards stylized textures. It's not an easy one to pin down, and I am still working on it.

what is the software used?
Hi @preethamrajr the base model was created in 3ds Max. I then imported it into Zbrush for finalising form and posing before taking it back into 3ds Max for retopology. The texture was done in 3D-Coat with some touch ups in Photoshop :)
your model is fantastic!
Thank you @yzaack, glad you like it!

This is from Battlefront?
It says battlefront 'millennium_falcon_battlefront.fbm' I was going to use this to render in a tutorial with a credit - but doesn't this copyright belong to the game company? - im worried and i don't want to get sued @kenjimarcio
would really like to see the interior modeled as well.
This looks exactly like the SW battlefront Millenium Falcon model. If it is, you should really put it in the description that its a rip instead of posting it like it's your own work. If this is your own work, great job the modeling is fantastic and the texturing really complements the geometry.
how do you make the windows look transparent
Ouaouuuh,  impressive !
God bless the texturing.....
Compatible with unity.. yet you can't actually see the model in unity....

Hi! 

The strange thing, 250 downloads and no one mentioned that downloaded file is not as displayed, it`s without muscles, skeleton only... or is something I missed?
Hi dendenis82,

I have downloaded it right now. Just to try. I had never done it. I could dounload the whole thing. I comes in different separated OBJ files, corresponding to the different objets that composed the model when I uploaded. The first one of them is bones. not the Whole skeleton since I removed some hiden bones. Then come the other files with muscles. Could it be that you opened only the first file?
My bad, it`s ok now.
It`s even more cool than I`ve expected: to have skull and ecorche at one.
Thank you for explaining, maybe my misunderstanding will help someone.
And thank you for sharing.
You are very wellcome. Im glad you find it cool
Is there any way to get all the files in one model? I'm trying to 3D print it and the alignement is hard to do.
the model was not created specifically for printing, but for virtual visalization. If you simply print the pieces separatelly and then try to asamble them, they may not match beacause some of them  may even intersect each other. The process of preparing a mesh for printing is very complex. To get all the files toguether you just need to import them all in a 3d software, such as Maya or ZBrush, But in order to print them toguether they must be not just diferent objects in one file, but a single mesh, not even an boject compound of several combined meshes. One good way to do it is by using ZBrush's dynamesh, but even when you get you single mesh you wiill find that There is a lot of holes and caves that you have to fix. All this process takes quite a lot of work. If you are not familiar with it it will take you quite a while to research and learn it. If you  make it I will love to see the result. Good luck!
Thanks
thank you for sharing this model
excellent work
Thanks, this is amazing and you are awesome! :)
This is amazing and so detailed! Thank you for sharing it! Just out of curiosity how long did it take you to create?
Great model, but would have been better with a full skeleton instead of more than half of it missing.
thank you. This is An absolutely  incredible model & I can't believe the detail!.

Was this done using an UAV and Photoscan?
Too often people describe normal photos as stunning.  When this loaded and popped before my eyes, it actually took my breath away.  This is the first time I think I can actually say that photography stunned me.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Very few people are even aware this technology exists.
Thanks ! It is a wonderful technology but the actual  place itself is absolutely beautiful.
where did you map those textures?
I'm an aerial photographer : the textures come from aerial photos taht I shot. The software I use automatically generates the 3D model from the photos, and then extracts the textures from the photos, and maps them onto the model. 
The chateau itself is located at the small village of Hautefort in Dordogne, Perigord France.
What Software did you use? Great product
I use Acute3D's fantastic software. Please refer to my interview on sketchfab blog here : http://disq.us/8khw9s for more details.
Fantastic 3D scanning. Unfortunately, as always with these methods, thousands of points and unnecessary faces that increase the model size without making any real additional details (the texture is suffcient) :)
Thanks ! 
I agree with you, total size is a bit high. 
Note that this model was uploaded a year ago. There has been many improvements regarding data volume optimization since then. It might be worthwhile for me to compress the model and re-upload it.
I'l give it a though when I have some time to spare :)
Bonsoir Gerpho

Pourquoi parler anglais entre Francophone ?  
En fait je trouvais l'idée du scan3D  intéressante dans le cadre d'un simulateur de vol comme FlightGeart qui manque cruellement de bâtiment caractéristique. Mais comme tout moteur 3D Temps réel la recherche des optimisations est un des points les plus importants. Quand je vois un pan de mur (qui ne nécessite que 4 points et 2 triangles) constitué de plusieurs centaines de points et faces je me rend compte du travail monstrueux qu'il faudrait faire :(
Mais si cela vous intéresse (par curiosité au moins) je serais heureux de réaliser ce travail sur l'un de vos châteaux pour montrer la différence avant et après optimisation :)

Amicalement Emmanuel
Bonjour Emmanuel

Plusieurs réponses : 
- Même s'il y a beaucoup de francophones qui visitent sketchfab, il y a majoritairement des non francophones, donc je m'astreins à tout commenter en anglais. Je fais exception pour une fois

- Le compromis entre taille du modèle et perte du détail n'est pas facile à trouver, et dépend des applications. On m'a déjà refusé des scans parce qu'ils étaient trop simplifiés ! mais c'est vrai que ça ne convient pas aux applications temps réel

- le bruit dans le mesh fait aussi partie de ce qui rend un modèle vivant, ce qui fait qu'on reconnait au premier coup d'oeil le scan du modèle de synthèse. Même plaquer une texture photographique sur une surface simplifiée (4 points pour un plan) ne donne pas le même rendu.

- Plus prosaïquement, je ne suis pas assez compétent pour simplifier un modèle sans que ça devienne un truc mou et sans détails, et c'est très chronophage (monstrueux?) par ailleurs. Mais, oui, ça m'intéresse d'essayer.... On peut peut être continuer cette discussion par mail ? le mien est disponible sur ma page profil.

A bientot peut être 

Philippe
Hi Gerpho

It's true! I'm sorry for this weak moment :( But I admit, to my shame, that English is not really my specialty.

I will therefore continue in French but by email :)

Regards Emmanuel
Its like a photo but you can move around in it!
This is the future of taking photos!!
Amazing !!
Simply perfect!
Thanks
Really wonderful!
Is this model produced by Smart3D, please?
Yes it is :-)
Your model is unique in that the roof ridge lines are straight and the rotunda roofs are rounded as they would be in reality.  I have found other 3d photogrammetry programs not able to produce this result. Did you do any post editing in your model to produce this result?  Or is your style in planning your flight path and capturing these structures the key to this result?
I didn't do any post-editing on this model. 

I believe that my key to high quality models is carefull flight planning, many photos, high quality optics (I use professionnal nikon cameras and optics), and of course the fact that I shoot from a plane, hence the camera is hand-held, and I can select the angles of view and framing that are required to give the best results. Plus I always post process the photos before inputing them into the 3D software, plus a very good 3D processing software (namely Smart3Dcapture in this case).

I consider it's a complete photographic process, and I do my best to use all my know-how as a professionnal photographer to produce the best results.

very realistic, I like
It’s always a balance, but as you know, a higher RI is required on the cornea. It should be impossible to see light on the other side

@TheHallwylMuseum can you explain more on the camera array...how many placements, position...have you tried less-elaborate camera array/type...thanks again and keep up great work...
@jamesoneill Certainly, it consist of four tripod mounted cameras as seen in this picture https://i.imgur.com/PNpKAsp.jpg They can be triggered simultaneously from a hand held remote. Here is a short time laps from the actual scan https://youtu.be/J4FGhv6MMxI this process was repeated at three different hights.

Here is our first go at an interior scan https://skfb.ly/66J8s It was done with one camera and less than 300 images.

@komoduz Thank You :D
@encho Ok i fixed it, now it should work, thank You for feedback :D
@Lubus Thank you, it works! How did you fix it by the way? I would like to know how to do it, as with my models I also end up hovering above them with no way of getting in..

Ive tried to complete low poly designs but honestly I'm a lost soul does anyone have any tips that i can use to get started i really love this style but can't seem to replicate it for my own use any help would be much appreciated  thank you
Hi @THEEDSTAR1!
Do a google search for Cinema 4D Low Poly look or as variation geometric look. You'll find a lot :)
This is awesome! *___*
What material did you use for water?
@megicizmadija Thanks! :D
It uses the default Sketchfab shader with high reflectivity and the albedo texture plugged into the Specular slot (Specular PBR workflow).
I baked the original texture in Blender, mostly using gradient mapping of the light direction^^
Here is a little insight in the workflow =)
https://blog.sketchfab.com/art-spotlight-low-poly-island/
Nice
really deatiled
The lighting is so well rendered, this is awesome! Imagine a game that consists of randomly generated nodes like this, that would be so fun to play.
@domdragon7 Thanks! :D Maybe one day we'll see such a game created :)

Thanks alban, i've sculpted it in Zbrush. The body base mesh (w/o helmet) is property of Digital Extreme.
Mega cool! You only have to work on the quality of the model itself (maybe to make the eyes are more clear) And we'll wait to add it to the game!

PS Will the tail in a back of the head moves?
The model itself it's the only thing i'm not allowed to modify ^^ sorry. The eyes on the original model are much more clear, i have to use a trick to make them work inside this visualizer so they look much more blurry than they actually are ;) The tail will move and wiggle!
after sculptining extract normal map and other map via substance designer ? then texture and paint in the substance painter and export all map from substance painter . then about tint map i dont know how to work with tint map in substance painter or you can take that job to photoshop.? plz i love your work and you are one of my inspiration the first time i saw your mag skin i was mind blown and i also sent you a firend request on steam my steam name is mani1414 plz i want to contact and learn from you, i hope you reading this love your work once again and plz be my teacher or friend maybe and my english is not that good tho. plz plz accept me as a studen and love from india.

I would like to thank you for your comment! Years ago I opened my youtube channel where I planned to do various tutorial videos ... everything motivated me ...
However I no longer feel like doing tutorials = (, when I do I end up speeding up because I simply end up getting bored in the process.
Too bad I guess I have designer wood but not much teacher.
That's why I decided to give these models so that people learn .. based on seeing and modifying = 3
@ctool Nice, it shows that you are decided and focused. No problem, I'll try to learn too as well.
Genial modelo, muy bien hecho! no sabes cuanto te agradezco, llevo tiempo buscando como dar el efecto de las lineas (cell shading) pero ningun tutorial que encontraba me funcionaba. gracias a ti podre ver como funciona de primera mano :D
Es increíble lo que se puede hacer con el cell shading, por un momento en la preview pensé que era una imagen de un anime y no un modelo XDDD

@torilo Por nada compañero, animo en tu proyecto =D

súper genial, me encanta la adición del contorno.

sigan con el trabajo increíble y espero que hagan más.
how did you get black outline?
@tailredtwintails (Translate Google) :P no english.

In blender You simply select the model and you go to the box modifiers in properties, you add a Solidify in OFFset, you set it to the maximum, you activate Flip normals, and finally in Material index ... in the left option you put the number of the material to use. for example, the material of character 1 is its texture, because material 2 is its contour color, so you put it 1 because 0 counts as the first.

I hope you understand ;).
@ctool thanks alot :D ill try do that, and learn blender just for it xD. 

i mainly use 3ds max and zbrush

Do you do a high poly model before, then a low poly and bake the details on it ? or something else ?

Wow, great model!
strongly...
is the arm rigged by any chance?
@jordanger88 Unfortunately not, no.
Is the resolution good enough to print real size?
@Warkha The highpoly has a better resolution, but doesn't have the normal detail the textured model does.
@deryckeredries I should of purchase the high res one then.
To late now I guess.
@Warkha If you send the purchase confirmation to dries.deryckere@me.com, I can send you the highpoly file for you to mess around with.

right. but actually I have been surprise to capture this detail.
Geoffrey, You can pick up the corrected model on the Google Drive. Unfortunately without textures. Recover textures without the original photos takes a lot of time. Maybe later will try to restore the texture.
Thanks you very much. Indeed if you work on the model, you loose the texture. But thanks anyway :)
Geoffrey I don't know how in Memento Beta, but in Agisoft can do the trick:
1. Align the photo.
2.A dense cloud.
3. The construction of the model. 
4. Save the project.
5!!! If the model requires correction, we export it in .obj. In a third party program (ZBrush or another) we repair mesh.
6. Import fixed .obj in Agisoft. (You need to open a previously saved project and import the new obj file.) New file will replace the old.
7. To create the texture. Voila. The model with texture can be imported.
Actually never try to do that with Memento Beta. I will have a look how I could rebake the texture.
Very good model. If you look at the texture map can be seen a few good models. We hope to see them soon ... Thanks Geoffrey.
Awesome!) You are use 1 camera? Or More?
Amazing. Panning around your excellent scan of this fantastic sculpture with the out-of-focus background, I feel like I'm in a movie :)
Ankapt: I use only one camera and I make all the picture by moving around.
Juliatruchsess: Thanks you very much. I am glad you like it :).
hey, are your models 3d printable? if not, may I clean them up and get them ready to be downloaded and printed by users?
thanks for the offer. However I have no problem to make printable version of 3D scan by myself. Actually, you have a all bunch of them at:
https://www.myminifactory.com/users/geoffrey.marchal

Usually I clean the model myself otherwise it is the people at MyMiniFactory doing it.
I could release this model for 3D printing by tomorrow on my MyMiniFactory account.
that would be super cool! thanks!!
You are welcome. Please mind that MyMiniFactory check the printability prior to release the model. So the model might me on-line after one week. But this is due to MyMiniFactory ;)
Very much looking forward to a printable file of this. I took a stab (no pun intended!) at fixing the sword myself a while back, but failed miserably.
The printable version has been sent for checking. I guess within a week the model will be available.
dear Marchal:
I am a designer located at Madrid, I was very interested in your scan so I download and having fun into 3DMax.
Would you like another sword for your model??
I can performance and model whatever is needed, so in retribution to your job, I thought you will find it fine;
In any case, I am a passionate of 3D scanning by any process, and yours is wonderfull.
Thank You very much for your time getting into the web.
I really apreciate scanning issues, 
yours sincerley
Dear 1.1render,

Thanks for your proposition but I have already done a sword for this model. The printable model of this sculpture will be available on my MyMiniFactory account. I will post the link as soon they review and release the model. Thanks again for your offer.

Best regards

Geoffrey

Hey, I just found out this model was featured on '10 AMAZING TURNTABLE 3D MODELS' by It's Art Magazine. Congrats!

http://www.itsartmag.com/features/10-amazing-real-time-3d-models/
I though this looked familiar, https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/L12-Shipyard-Scene-Touch-resize/5857017 is this you, or did someone steal you design?
Awesome. I love the little details.
Wow, you've reached 1,000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

Really nice to watch with an Oculus Rift
They have the full set of this on vr chat, and i want to say, I love it~ its beautiful and perfect to look at, I just hope that I will get to see the real thing at some point in life, So i am very gratful for this being free so people {like me, disabled} can use platforms to see this beautiful place~ And to think of how much time and effort it took to remake these peices, well i would pay you for just letting us see it, but these places are priceless~ 

*got so worked up writing this and looking at it I teared up, Kudos from one artiest to another, that is the highest honer~*
@leoninusfate Thank you for your wonderful comment! This is exactly what we have been hoping for - to let visitors in who couldn't otherwise visit. Best regards from the staff at Skokloster Castle, The Royal Armoury and the Hallwyl Museum.

Really like this. It reminds me of my own style but yours is much better!
@ryanwoodcock thank you! I wouldn't say my style is better, it's just more detailed in textures. I really love your style because of it's simplicity and readablity! I think your style would definatly work better in a game than mine.
good work love the textures

Amazing character design and modelling.
The pose feels a bit weird - as it doesn't really look like it's running - more like it's slipping on the ice.. half in the air somewhat.
Aside from that - and that's me nit-picking, I am absolutely stunned at how gorgeous this is
She's adorable!

Dude, this is awesome- if you ever make a Bumblebee for this price, I'll buy it
null
Hi, was it made in blender only? I mean sculpting, retopology, grooming, uv, texturing, mapping, shading, skinning, rigging, animation?
null
@scotopicone I've made the modeling, rigging, UV, animation, etc with Blender. I've just used gimp to merge and edit the different part of my textures (vertex colors, AO, etc.)

@delange2212 Thanks ! I'll add a bumblebee to my list of insect to model !

@2dand3d Thank you ! :D
Amazing work. Do you do all your texturing in Blender as well? Any addons you use to help with texturing?
@paulchambers3d Thank you ! :D 

Well generally my workflow is the following, when I've finishied to model the creature, I work the rigging and I test with a basic animation in order to check if it has a correct topology. If there are no problems, I do the UV Mapping. Then I start to paint on the model the base colors (for this model the yellow and black base), then (not for this model but for my dinosaur for example) I duplicate the model on which I add a multiresolution modifier in order to sculp the HD version of the model (wrinkles, scales, etc). After that I apply this modifier and in the vertex paint mode, I generate the dirty vertex colors, that I bake. I do the same thing with The AO and the Normal map. I also add a dirt texture that I paint on the previous model. When I've finished, I merge all of this textures (colors, vertex colors, dirt) which made my final texture.
That's awesome! Thanks for the detailed reply. Great workflow using the dirty vertex colors.
Well done. That's a staff pick!
nice!

thanks Bart! really worked hard on it! :)
love it! :)
thanks bondaru apprieciate the compliment!
very nice, and inspiring too! I'll have to finish my diorama now (hand painted as well). I started one of a tavern but need to redo the UVs and some re-texturing. I like the vertical set up of the scene; the bottom platform up to the tower spire.
if i can give some tips @arlendecambre work as modular possible, i made one wall, 2 wooden beams, 1 grass patch, 1 fern, 3stone variations, the rest is just playing ith lego and fitting pieces together till you have a nice composition :p of course i made a design already so i followed it
No doubt that's good advice. I've definitely gotten more organized with modular building on another project I did since then, so I'm going to chisel back at it!
I'm working on a character with hand painted textures. How is your workflow for your texture work?
Are you just using Photoshop or do you use a 3d painting software?
@andi-lo  well im not that great with characters myself, but i can share my workflow from this scene shortly :p
first of all, unwrap is everything, check it over and over until you have no, next to none stretching, in that way you can texture your work more easely.
then i started texturing non organinc things, like the walls and barrels, in photoshop,
for more organic stuff like the stones, i used 3d-coat, i can greatly advise it for character texturing.
thanks for your reply :). I just recently got the trial version of 3d coat and you're right it is indeed perfect for hand painted textures. I tried substance painter 2 and quixel at first but got really disappointed from both. Glad to hear that I am sharing the same workflow and tools.
@andi-lo i got to say i really love substance haha even more than 3d coat since im more a realistic kind of guy, but it just isnt good enough to do handpainted textures, believe me i tried and failed miserably haha
@Sander.Vander.Meiren don't get me wrong. I was disappointed of the interface and UI design of Substance Painter. I don't say you can not produce good results with it. I spent more then an hours of setting up until I could draw the first stroke in SP2 (I even needed a video tutorial that guided me to how I load my already existing textures into SP).

Where as in 3d-coat everything seemed much cleaner and organized. I imported the obj, added my texture to the selected UV and I was good to go. I like professional software that manages to stay clean (that's why I dislike Maya either).
@andi-lo yeah everyone his own favorite :p

clever what you did with the outer trees :)

Just kidding, keep it up. LOVE the silhouetted trees around the edge ;)
sweeeeeeet :D love it
Love this. Adding to my collection!
Came back to give this a Staff Pick! Love how the peripheral trees blend into the background.
Thanks @seori! 

And thanks to everyone else for the wonderful comments as well <3
You make me want to learn how to do this and giving it up immediately because I'm not going to be this awesome at the same time.
Amazing colours and shapes, great work!
beautiful visual solutions!

@OysterJuice I definitely recommend the first thing you said (not so much the second, but I appreciate the comment ;)

@curlscurly Thank you! Had a hard time settling on colours, so that means a lot :)

@paulopina Thanks!
Like this one a lot. But what about the tops of the main trees? They aren't transparent, and look a tad weird from a top-down angle.
@SpaceCadetNiner Thanks! But yeah, you're not wrong. This one is very much dependent on viewing angle - even with transparency, the effect of the trees blending into the background gets lost at higher angles.
Simple and so..beautiful! *-*

download?
@bronywilson I'll enable downloads when it is complete :)
Love the model! And the fur on his back brings a really grotesque aspect. Excellent!
I suppose if youre animating this then it'll be like one of those hybrid FMV cutscenes from the PSX Final Fantasy games (the ones with the actual rendered models composted over the video). Awesome job mate!

What model program do you use?
It looks so... realistic
KILL OR BE KILLED!!!
Download?
download?
The only way for that to be scarier is if it was real. An amazing job
Okay let me get this off my chest: Can I use this model for a secret boss for a game I plan on making about a robot hunting ghosts when I learn how to code(credit will be given)(textures and animations may change in final version)(If you say no then screw the question the awesomeness of the model pays for your time)
@the-regressor You said in the title that it is complete, so where is the dowload that you said you would put up? I can't find it.
null
the regressor wont put it download Omega Flowey
@BeakBlack You Called For Help
I really wish I could have this one lol, I'm trying to make a game, and I would love to have this guy as a boss or something lol

Its amazing teach me how to make something like this people
THIS IS HORRIFYING. (In a good way LOL)

Great work. Staff picked.
Those materials and texturing work are amazing!
I especially love the transition on the tail. Very well done!
@essimoon Thanks! I'm glad you liked that part. The transition on the tail was a lot of experimentation. It kept me several days thinking about how to do it. At the end looked much better than I expected.
@bartv Thanks for the staff pick :D
@AndresCasta hehe, definitely worth the effort, looks really well done! :D
This is so good! I'm so jealous!
this is sooooo beatiful!!!
WHEre did you make this at?
@Silentcent770 I used ZBrush for sculpting, Maya for retopo, UV's and rigging, Substance Painter and Photoshop For texturing.

Plus you should add a bit more metalness on the scales to make it look a bit less like plastic imo.

Thanks
thanks
Thanks mate, it's great, helped me a lot.
Thanks for this download. Wonderful start for a low poly character.
I enjoy recreating characters, but lack of any kind of art training always leaves me frustrated with getting proportions right.
Using this as a base mesh is incredibly helpful and lets me skip the part of modelling that's the most difficult and least enjoyable for me.
Thank you!
Thanks man, i am new to blender so this is a big help

Hey, came here from V2. I must be dumb or something, because I can't figure out how the UV mapping works for this model in Unity?
thanks for the great model
@joedorman same problem, I don't understand in what program you're suposed to open  it with so that the materials would be lined up because there is only one submesh for the textures
@joedorman al though you would easily be able to do it using blender and create new submeshes or use the texture paint tool
update: import it to blender and import the textures and it will have the submeshes done
Amazing this one will help me make my own headstrap mod. i dont exactly want the deluxe audio strap as my own headphones still sound better than that thing. but i do want the ease of use. hopefully my 3d printer is up to the task haha
Can't wait to show this off in my Oculus home xD
nice work, nicely modelled
@raffia16th Wow, can you show the result?

shame the obj doesn't have the materials properly applied, im sure there is an easy fix but if it worked out of the box no issue it would've been perfect. Thanks a lot nonetheless

However, on the walking/turning around animations the base of the tentacle don´t move so the mesh of the tentacle overlap.

Maybe what we're looking at are spinning stones. I can see prehistoric folk sitting around the campfire and having a little friendly competition. Perhaps even inter-tribal competition which is why they made them so ornate. To me the somewhat uniform shapes mean it can be grabbed and spun from just about any angle, with grooves that fingers can get in for that last flick-of-the-wrist spinning. Furthermore, I bet some of those spiral shapes look really cool when spinning quickly.
Weapon?
Just add some rope and you have a terrific stone flail.
Are these models available for download? It would be fun to research thier use by 3D printing them and trying to use them for things.  -Thank you!

Incredible detail! We're giving it a Staff Pick :)
By the way, did you know you can embed this model on your website?
Love it. Could be cool to add a few 3D annotations to walk us through the base.
I really appreciate your positive comments. I completely agree with you and I will try to add 3D annotations)
We suggested your work for this week's It's Art roundup:

thank you very much, Bart :-)
Awesome!!!!
y' better watch out for Aliens From the game DOOM 4
I was exploring this scene in the Oculus Sketchfab VR app, and while I was looking at it, I was struck with the vivid thought that we might not make it to this point.. that war or disease or disaster would destroy our species, and that this digital vision would be all that would be left of humanity's dreams for the future. It made me so sad I had to turn off the app. I'm sure this wasn't an intended effect of this scene, but I thought I'd share.
you are so pessimistic
admone - would you be interested in making this exact scene but with something closer to this other capsule uploaded in SketchFab?  https://skfb.ly/Sw7U
@FilipAAOfficial Hi Filip) Of course, you can use this model) it`s free)
@FilipAAOfficial Hi Filip. You can use all models, no limits)

Me encanta el estilo.
WOW! Great interpretation, one of my favorite movies too (great French director btw). Makes me want to watch it again. Staff pick!
So well executed. The subtle background pattern is nice.
Very nice, I watched it recently ^^ I like how you give your own interpretation of the characters!
Thank you very much guys! I'm glad that you like it :)
@alban Thank you for the stuffpick! Yeah, i love that movie too! I think this one is the best Besson's works as a director and of course as a writer. Btw, got the parcel from you. I was expecting something bit different but i'm happy to have the stuff that you have sent ^___^
Great work!
@martincrownover thank you!

Gran trabajo, mas aun partiendo de imagenes disponible en internet. Enhorabuena.
Thanks @abbyec, this would be a good one for Italy... don't you think?

Gracias @javibelloso, es interesante dejar a veces la cámara a un lado y ponerse a experimentar.
I do! ?
Very nice. Staff pick.
Good works!
Add an external link on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum
Wow thanks for the staff pick @alban! 

Also, good suggestion @moroplogo
Te ha quedado estupendo, de dulce, como decimos por aquí. Y los comentarios muy interesantes, lo de los demonios no lo sabía.
Muchas gracias @lolamuseo, no todo va a ser el modelo 3D. El contenido histórico en este caso es fundamental.
¡BRAVO! Con este último experimento has abierto un camino fundamental para la difusión del patrimonio en 3D. Lo mejor de todo es haberlo logrado a partir de 50 fotografías digitales.
Estoy pensando en las posibilidades que habrá a medida que se vayan digitalizando los fondos fotográficos de los archivos. ¡Enhorabuena!
cucok
Fantastic job.   Please consider making it downloadable.  Thanks. Roger USA
Spectacular!!!  This is the most realistic of all pictures of the Colosseum ever made.  All the old photographers envy your accomplishment!  This is one of the most important buildings of all time.  Keep up the great work....
Hey @oldstudio! Thank you so much for your comment! Having this masterpiece of ancient architecture in 3D in good for everyone. Researchers, professors and general public can enjoy it without leaving home!
This is marvelous! Amazing work!
Very impressive ! A simple question : animations and infowindows are made with... ?
Awesome Work !
Very professional and informative!
@plankf thanks! I hope this model is used to spread knowledge about the roman world!

@rayle thanks :) Unfortunately no custom thumbnail option yet, what would you like to add?

One of the best models I've ever seen on here. Great expression and materials :)

Nice result. My scans of fruit are always a disaster: https://skfb.ly/DRv6 (too similar everywhere). Do you help place camera's manually or did photoscan figure it out?
Neat! You're close to the best fruit scan I've ever seen, the ninja banana by @r0m1r https://sketchfab.com/models/1eb98fce7f4c41ed9d198b089dacdac9
@alban Thanks! It's a shame I'm a few weeks late for that 3DST challenge.
@james I feel your pain. I tried to scan a tomato on a vine before and it was a nightmare. Got the same result as your lemon, even after I peppered it with stickers. Luckily it looks like mandarines have enough texture variance to work properly. No manual camera placement required :)
@geoffreymarchal Just enabled downloading. Thanks Geoffrey!
thanks for sharing :)
JUST AMAZING.
Any chance of getting the texture files? They are not in the zip file :(
@geoffreymarchal You're welcome :)
@fenongenon Thank you! I appreciate it.
@vdeleon All sorted. I just re-uploaded a new zip file packaged with a cleaner mesh and a neater texture. Thanks for pointing that out!
one of the best scans i've seen!
Excellent! Thank you sir! It's a beautiful scan :)
Fabulous scan !
Again ... im speachless ^^
I want to eat it, but my hand can't reach it... why? there is a forcefield or a invisible obsticle between my hand and the mandarine. 
gj 5/5 ?????
Wow! I just scanned some citrus fruits today! Here is the raw scan of the lemon: https://skfb.ly/JnVG
?????????
How do you do this?
@andrewleonard it's a technology called 'photogrammetry'. Here's more info:

http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/121838008009/how-to-set-up-a-successful-photogrammetry-project
Thanks, I read it
What software do you use to process your images?
Is there free software?
@ronjart - Nice result! Especially for a raw capture.
@andrewleonard - For this model I used Agisoft Photoscan, but I've been experimenting with many different software packages.
Currently I'm using the new Reality Capture Promo which is very powerful but comes at a price tag of 33 Euros a month.
If you're just starting out, I would recommend Autodesk's '123D Catch' which is free, easy to use, and can even be run off a smartphone.

So delicious...
This looks so realistic it's making me hungry :(

download? :s

@cerubin @firecrauter @yukiyurihara The nude version can be downloaded here - https://sketchfab.com/models/552df9e9e5da43a1b4f037dc62400888
The nude version with this pose is down, I can't preview it :(

Maybe you could add the pose in the existing nude one, or reupload it?
@zorfake That's odd, it seems fine to me - what's the issue you're having? Can you see the model page at all - do you have NSFW enabled? Or can you just not download it?
@neethree I can see the uncensored one just fine, but it only has the laying down pose, not the standing up one like the censored one here.
@neethree any way to get this version with clothes on it? i bought the nude version
Nice!!!!!!!
devilishly cute ? ?
could I please get a download for this model
This Sketchfab 3D model has been deleted.

http://www.blendernation.com/2016/09/19/favourite-blender-art-sketchfab-week-14/

Enjoy! :)
The lighting looks so good, the atmosphere is palpable in this one! :3
I just noticed that the snowflakes are just grey squares - you should be able to put a texture and a transparency map on them, have you tried?
Bart, why this work does not Staff picks ? She's great!
@zloy_pingvin because the snowflakes are wrong, see my comment below. Once that's fixed I'll surely pick it :)
@Bart , done!
Wonderful, that's a staff pick! It's also really nice to explore in VR.
Love the ambient feeling, nice work
Nice atmosphere  <3
??????? ?????!
Amazing work! How long did it take to create it all?
@nebic 5 days (10-12 hours).
What is your technique to generate particle for Sketchfab ?
@francoisespagnet Just simple 3 falling animated mesh.
This is so beautiful
cool!
this is soooooo beautiful :D  :D ??

Thanks guys! 

@Dr.Agonite Yea! i did all the textures with 3D Coat and ZBrush! :D

This is very cool!!!!

@nataliak thank you! :D
aww, this topology on face, how i can get that!?
@pavelnoskov it triangulated the model on upload, so it's not 100% clean, but I typically start with edge loops around the eyes and the mouth, and then connect them.  Hope that's what you were asking!
Beautiful, beautiful model, great texturing and concept.
null
so beautiful
@xdraws thank you! that what i'm asked )
Hi again, how much smooth groups you used before adding normal maps? one?
@pavelnoskov everything is under a single smoothing group, I added some hidden edges manually to assist the bakes, but that was pretty much it!
amazing job
Thunder thighs! I like the texture on the ground plane also.
Love this so much! Love the curves!
i wish i could do that too! :D
Awesome work!!
Hello :)
How can I download it? I'd like to make a figurine with her :3
Great model! Unfortunately the link to the original concept seems to have broken. Do you have the name of the artist?
@jiggeh sorry for the delay in the response, the original artist seems to have gotten rid of their artstation, I'll try to find a link to their work again and update the description!
This one and a few others of yours I would like to download to try to 3D print. Not for resell of course but for personal enjoyment. Is there any way I could get the 3D model
Wow it's amazing !

Love this!! Great work.
@etienne.beschet Merci Etienne :) Une bonne petite série !
@gav.grant Thank you!!
@ibrews Thanks a lot!
@bartv Thank you Bart (although it doesn't appear as staff pick anymore) :) And I will get a close look to the category guideline. Cheers!
@aurelien_martel great model as always! I'm putting your staffpick back, somehow it got lost in the void :P
This would make a great VRChat level
Wow thank you for that.

how did you got this model dude??
well nvm.....i just checked it and found out it is one of the ironman 3 mobile games model.
still it looks nicer that the mobile one due to metal surface i.e glossy and reflective texture.
btw,what maya work you did on this one?
@biswayan ithe metalic material you mention can easily be simple sketchfab setting, not much your can do in  maya for that
@twitte_king yeah i kinda realised that after i uploaded some models there are glossy/matte setting slider in the menu.

Btw you can actually change the texture gloss and make it look like it's made of metal in maya
Thank you so much man, i love your work. i've taken the freedom to rig this model, i'll definitely give credits to you if i'm posting it some where :D
I am a complete beginner and i uploaded the obj file into blender but it is untextured and i found some unwrapped images with it so can anyone help me in how can i appy it to model?

that's a masterpiece .... nice work pal
This is absolutely amazing work. I can tell that this would have taken many man hours. did you do it all by yourself or a team effort? Regardless, just Awesome.

@bartv, thank you. In fact Sketchfab now is better service for placing and sharing panoramic pictures although it was intended for an another things.
@sgmgdrv cool! What do you feel made it better for you?
@bartv 

That what's i really like

1. I can upload the scene directly from Ps (it's really nice, i don't need export textures to jpeg and replace its EXIF to get the working panoramas every time) 
2. Fast loading scenes for viewing (it works faster then Facebook or Artstation)
3. Postprocessing  and embedding pictures in the other sites (actually i went here when I tried to embed pictures in the project on the Behance, i don't know is there anybody else who uses sketchfab like me)

What i would like too

The limits of zooming scene (as option maybe). The point is that the scene wouldn't become too small when the zoom is reduced.

An increasing FPS on the phones in VR-mode. I don't know what's the matter, it's likely a hardware problem or android's bug. I can't use now google cardboards with sketchfab on my Xiaomi Redmi 4 pro because of low fps (mb the other models of the phones don't have such problems). 

However Sketchfab now is the best service with great functionality for me.
That sounds really cool, I'll share your feedback with the team!

Regarding zooming - we actually have that! It's called 'Camera Limits', but needs a PRO subscription to use:

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003399103-Camera-Limits

I've added one week of PRO to your account so you can give it a try :)

I don't know that specific phone type - is it a high-end one? Your scenes should run fine..
@bartv oh, thank you so much for the week of pro, i'll experiment with the 3d-settings. 

About the phone, it's cheapest chinese 150$ phone with Snapdragon 625 and Adreno 506 as video accelerator. It shows single not-VR scene normally with high FPS, but it's going to slow down after turning on VR-mode. I think it's a specific phone trouble and i'm going to check it out with other phones of my friends.
Cool work, Sergey.
@sgmgdrv I'm curious if you found the PRO features useful?
@bartv I've been trying the pro functional (thanks for giving a try). The point is that i'm using simple diffuse map on the sphere and i just don't need the most options now excluding the zoom limitation and some post-filters (but i'm going to make the 3d-pictures and then i'll need more features). 

Please don't think it means that more basic features should be changed to pro. It's the wrong way — just take a look at EA and their Battlefront 2, they decided to make the paid functionality at all and only they received is alot of hate.
@sgmgdrv we won't make such basic features PRO, don't worry :) We strongly believe every artist should get all the tools they need to make their work look awesome. That's why new shaders like SSS are free too!

Wow! 
This would 3D Print very well too.
Truly Amazing model Malcus! The perfect blend of 3D muscular details with highly expressive facial work! Your 2d work carries over REALLY well to the 3D realm! I have a book project I’m working on that I feel your character modeling style would be a perfect match for. I think you’d really love the challenge! Please get in touch via my email or send me a message via my Sketchfab contact and I can fill you in on the details.

Neat model! Could use a more detailed and stronger ao map on it to emphasize the car's shapes and details. The insides of wheels and brake calipers especially stand out as a bit too bright.
@ollitei Thanks! It was a part of a car configurator: https://www.behance.net/gallery/11973251/Porsche-911-HTML5-Customizer

Besides tires and lights it just a model, no mapping or texture.
@karolmiklas Ah, makes sense then. I checked out the video on that link you pasted. Pretty cool idea blending a 3d car into google street view and using the location as a cube map for reflections too.

Gets my Staff Pick!
Amazing work man!
Outstanding! Could you share about the process of making decals and textures?
Hey Guys
The texture work and decals was done by me, 
All of it was done using substance Painter for the texture work itself.
As for the decals, i just made a flat square plain in the modelling software and made all the meshes i wanted to see (highpoly and detailed) and placed them within that square but not overlapping,then  baked it using the plain as the lowpoly and the decal meshes as the highpoly to create the normals maps.
After that it was about cutting up the flat plain that has the normals baked onto it, based on where the bakes are and then placing them as individual pieces of mesh around my object (spaceship).
  
Essentially all the decal details across the ship is from one texture map but broken it not little mesh pieces to be placed.

It's easy to make the decals, it just takes time to figure out where to place them and how much you should be put on, without making it look overwhelming. I found that less is more.
Oh as for the texture work for the other materials, i was using PBR (Colour,Metal,Rough).
 
Most of the breakup comes from the Roughness Map. 
The metallic map was just made as a single value, nothing complicated. 
The Colour map had very subtle colour breakup, mostly with values of 5-15% opacity on top of the base layer so it would not look overly dirty and to hide any potential repetition in the texture running across the mesh.
As for the UV's they were scaled up roughly 2x larger than the UV grid for resolution of the texture, varies for each texture, except the decal texture, that was 1x1 uv scale.
thank you very much for the reply. As i understand, the workflow by which this model was made, utilizes the same principles as Star Citizen developers do. I think this definitely deserves an article, as many artists would wish to understand the techniques deeper.
Thank you! 
Yeah it is based on Star Citizen methods, from what i have read and seen of their work.
Would have been much faster to have some great original concept work to follow, most of the design was based on does it feel good?, if not, redesign.
In saying that, reference was used.
Not sure about others, but when designing, its fun to be surprised by your own work.
The design went through around 100 Iterations, each to varying degrees of change, 180 iterations if you include the interior.
Yes there is an interior for this ship, but it is not ready yet

Oh my God! An Andromeda-size Sabre! This is all i wish for :) I hope CIGs will allow high quality models in game after the release, in this case i'll throw my money at you :)
Thank you! I would also love to see this in SC one day.
Haha thanks for the feedback and your support!

I think i will make more ships, feedback is somehow inspiring. 
If you want to follow the development of this ship, here is the link to the forum and
although the Exterior is done, still much to do for the interior.

https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/362232/aegis-valkyrie-wip

Plus there are some really high quality renders you can view :D
At first I thought it was a model straight from the Star Citizen! Good job indeed!
What did they use to make the ship? I'm new here..
It was all modelled in Maya and textured using Substance Painter
I've removed this model from 'Products & Technology' - that category is more for 'existing tech' content.
Will this ship appear on SC??? Niceeeee work and I would love to fly one! It look likes a kind of Sabre
It was designed with SC in mind, hopefully you will get to see it when modding becomes an available feature of the game. It was inspired by ships like the Gladius and Sabre. Thanks!

@rds2 Thanks, it was not easy to make.
I use Blender for everything, modeling, texturing, rigging and animating.

I use Blender also, but I created my original 3D model in 3D Studio release 2, some time ago, and imported it as a 3DS file, which scattered all the parts. So I had to use the Move part to origin feature, but then all the parent links were rotated wrong.  And those parts can't just be rotated, because everything below the parent rotates.  I am still finding things out about Blender.  At the same time, I am taking a class for Autodesk Maya 2016 as part of an architectural major.

Seems that all the spikes on all the legs would cause a very long render time.
@rds2 Jumping between programs sounds complicated.
If I would have used polygons for the spikes, yes, it could have caused a very long render time, but I just used a very small alpha (100 x 100 pixels)  texture which repeats on a plane to save polygons and keep the spider low poly for real time uses.

Thanks for this, Dennis! Did you included texture files in the download? 

I have access to Maya, C4d, Unreal and Unity, but I'm getting an error that SH3.png and Spinnen_Bein_tex.jpg are missing. Thanks!
And the textures? In unity3d the textures does not appear
you could almost put that in a video game
what software did you use to animate it
Whoa, this is amazing! I'm gonna include this in my free indie game~ :)

could you make this into a character with bones?
@clintko_ I made this ages ago when I was still learning Blender, so I didn't know how to rig. I do know now but I'm not going to bother.
very beautiful model!
That's neat!
@seafoam hontoni gyro? et tu lucy?
Wow, you've reached 1,000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@bartv Oh? I've always just done my own thing but that's pretty cool. Alright the next project I'm working on will be my 1000 milestone model.

bello sul serio
Wow thank you for sharing this beautiful work !
But I'm wondering about something :
When I open it in Unity, I have 1 mesh that group everything so when I put terrain texture, objects have this texture too and if I put objects texture, terrain have this texture too.
How can I do it ?
Thanks !
nice work
Nice! I wanted to see how it is done. Copy and Paste this ?

make more pls
@worx I will try my best
Is there textures to go along with it? Or is my settings bugged? Im beginning to think we add our own textures.
@Megasaur there should be a texture file where you can add the texture
@Megasaur if the textures are not added than you have add it to the model
@Megasaur or it because your using a different softwere

blender is the Superior 3d model software
hi when i import the model its was just pink and idk how to fix it can you help me
how do i import textures? It is just pink
@T0miX in blender only:

add an image texture and choose the texture in the browser

Thank you @alban , well,.. I caught myself to have a certain facility for the voxel lol :p

Thanks @ik2005 !
@kyan0s Any tip or tricks on how you created your landscape? The grass and water is what I'm curious about. Did you just carve it out with larger voxel erase brushes?

This one is just fantastic, very nice job.
Thanks @rickprokosch ! ^^) 

Well, First I have took the voxel brush [V] and I have modified its size, 5 for example, next I have started to draw the left and right shore freehand by touching the sides of the workspace to fill up the space that it delimited until have the right height for the grass. Still with that face brush I put a layer of grass on the rock. Then I fill the water with just 1 or 2 of tickness. From there, I have took a new voxel brush with the rock color, and with 1 or 2 of thickness and I redraw randomly as possible the shore over water but against the rock wall.

Once this is done, I have took the voxel brush with 1 of thickness and with another nuance of rock, and randomly again I paint on the rock wall. I do the same fo the grass and the little waves along the shore .

I hope I have answered your questions ^^) and sorry for my english :s lol
wow awesome job
Thanks @klapine ^^)
@kyan0s Thank you very much for the info. That's how I thought you probably did it and that's how I've been doing it in my scenes too. I'm always curious about how people use this app because some users have some pretty neat tricks!

You english was just fine, I understood the concepts you were writing about.

I've done a few fossilized quartzite riverbed sand ripples at Falls Park nearby. I didn't realize just how old they were until I started modeling them and reading what little reference material I could find only. People walk across them all them time, never noticing them as they're too busy looking at the falls or the rapids above and below.
is the geometry really looks like the original ?

Amazing texture work, so original! 
Would love to see a game with this kind of engraving-style graphics.
I've textured it and am making it so you can live in it.  See the pics at  https://plus.google.com/+FredBeckhusen/posts/aXwx5UpWBJ6

@bartv Thanks, i don't have a VR headset, so i just placed the model somewhat centered. Also, i couldnt lower the VR person reference thingy, so I had to scale it down, therefore the cockpit might look bigger than normal.
Liked the UI :)
Great work. I'm giving this a staff pick.
@bartv Thank you so much! :D
Amazing! Your ship cockpits are phenomenal.
@creativescape Thank you! I'm glad you like them :D

https://80.lv/articles/best-of-sketchfab-ladies-clouds-starships/
@bartv Thank you very much for letting me know. This is awesome :D
This is incredible, I would love to see this in-game on my Vive.
VR mode is whacked. I just want to see from inside the cockpit and I keep getting put inside the walls. None of the of the controls do much @ HTC Vive.
@shiniguro hmm, sorry to hear that. I don't have a VR device, but clicking on the VR mode, i could test the movement, and it seems it works with keyboard. It is possible that it doesn't work with the Vive controllers, but that will probably get fixed by the sketchfab devs.
@VattalusAssets Yeah the keyboard controls were the easiest to use. I think Sketchfab will improve it sometime. Anyway, thanks for uploading the art I enjoyed viewing it.
Amazing work! Could you make this downloadable though? :(
@Yiannis1234 Sketchfab has launched their store, now you can buy it
Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

https://sketchfab.com/bartv/collections/followers-milestones
Nice. I bought your other cockpit model. I might pick this up in the future. Let me know if you make a two seater cockpit. Cheers.
Thanks for the reply. Your model is good! I really enjoyed looking at it. Was just distracted by my VR issue. I'll give it another go soon.

Looks fun, but that gate pattern must make working the gears a bit of a challenge.
the only thing that could make this cooler is if you had slight independent jiggle of the motor/etc parts in an idle animation loop
flawless

It's a very good job in texture.
this is going to be a cool adition to the game
This is going to be so awesome in the game.  What's the ETA for when the players will finally see it included?
grat model and texture mega
the texture wont load for me for some reason... ive tried multiple times but it just ends up with a blocky texture and looks like its from minecraft
Click on the small square icon in the lower right of the image for the Rendering Options.
Nice but this has been here for 11 months? You have to start adding some of these old models sooner please.
Darkplasmaray, most of the creatures seen here in the gallery that are not in the game have been completed in everything but A.I. programming.  Due to the lack of needed programmers on the dev team that can handle this job (right now, only Jonas is doing it and he has many other jobs on the game other than just A.I. creation), it is making it difficult to get the many creatures incorporated into the game, including the Rockpuncher.
ONG PLEASE LET THIS BE A LAND & WATER CREATURE
It reminds me of a crab
looks like a shrimp crossed with a spider also it will probly spawn near loads of rock and will be affected by terra forming and its diet will by crushed rock maybe
Kinda like a lobster actually.
A Rock Lobster. :)
If this does not be in the game, I will breath heavily and type so fast, my fingertips and my keyboard will set ablaze.
This needs to be in the game
@Molejoules 
It was going to be one point but they changed their minds and are still not quiet sure. Maybe they'll change them though. :)
I think the Rock Puncher should punch subs like the Seamoth and the Cyclops! Instead of rocks! Meaning that you can implament it even without having terraforming in the game.
I have always wanted this creature in-game, and now it might have a chance!
Thank you
This is by far the best NPC I've seen so far and I'd really love to see it get implemented in the game. It's so cute.
Can't i download it??? if not could you please give me it, i really want to animate subnautica
I have a few ideas for the Rock puncher in-game.
Firstly, it's purpose.
The idea of a creature being able to alter terrain is a good idea, don't get me wrong. But since alteration of the terrain has been removed, The Rock Puncher won't be able to do anything to rocks. So instead, maybe it could just punch the sea floor if the player or aggressive fauna get close to it. Or maybe it could swat at them with it's big hands. It could also hit Submersibles if they come close enough. Every hit could do 45 damage.
Now, It's name.
Since the Rock Puncher won't be Punching Rocks anymore, here are some ideas for it's name:

Swat Lobster
Pollair Crab (Pollair is from the word Pollaire, which is Irish for Puncher.)
Rock Lobster (Since it's gray areas look like rock)

Thank you for letting me give my opinions.
why i existt

Thank you for Sketchfab! so great idea.
thanks!!It's great!
@alban Ah dude i cant tell did you scan this into point clouds, or just model it yourself using polygons, because i see some distortions in your model.
One of most beautiful scans i have seen.
Thank you.
Ciao  alban,
Hello,
my name is Massimiliano Cardinals.
I wanted to know if I use a 3D model in CC by 4.0 to make a video animation to sell on stockfootage sites .... this is possible?
naturally citing the author, the website, and the CC by 4.0.

Thanks and good job
@MassimilianoCardinali yes!

I'm actually not that familiar with the 3D printing pipeline... but if you wish to print this off.. I can help you out by personally sending you a proper setup if it's not too complicated to do? let me know what you need specifically dude :)
Great work!
Beautiful! What software do you use?
AMAZING STUFF...HOPE I GET IT PRINTED SOON
DOES .FBX FILE SAME AS .OBJ OR .STL WHICH IS PRINTABLE IN 3D ?
Amazing  bright model))
Thanks everyone! really appreciate the lovely comments :)... I'm very unsure about the technical side for 3D printing... but if anyone requires files or another file export to print in then please feel free to ask me and I'll email a .obj file or scene setup for you :)... This is still being polished btw so there will be a new update to this scene soon... (it's almost completed haha.. just nit-picking now)

Greate work and colour
Nice work. I love it.
We recommended your work for this week's Sketchfab roundup on IAMAG:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-51/

Enjoy! :)
@bartv 
Oh wow! awesome! Thank you Bart! :D:D:D

Also thank you to everyone else with the lovely comments again hehe :D!
Super cool :)
Loving this!
material in downloaded file absent! Can you hut them
@kaminore Oh you're right... I'm not actually sure how to fix this...

@bartv Hey Bart, my 3D upload isn't downloading the texture files as well... not really sure how I go about fixing this?
@kid.in.the.dark did you add those textures through our 3D editor perhaps? The download feature only returns the original file (it's a known issue).
@bartv 
Yeahhh... I updated this model's textures a few times... is there a way to include the texture files now without completely deleting this upload? If not I'll just manually send texture files on request then I guess haha.
You can use the re-upload feature to upload a new version of the model, and then include the texture maps. The material settings should be saved, but you may need to do some manual work.
@bartv Thank You! fixed it :)

@kaminore Try downloading it again :)
Excellent, glad I could help :)

Would be great to annotate the paintings so we know what we are looking at. Also: welcome to @Sketchfab!
Thanx a lot @alban I moved the camera in approx 2 meter increments along the walls while shooting across the room. I repeated this at 3 different heights. The resulting images, just short of 300, was processed in RealityCapture. I did this as a baseline test to se how the software would handle an interior like this. I´ve only scanned object before. See here: @TheRoyalArmoury @SkoklosterCastle It turned out much better than expected and we will definitely annotate this including links to hires images of some of the works. Stay tuned :)
Amazing indeed, easily one of the best interior scans I've seen so far. Do let us know when you've set up the annotations!
@bartv Wow, thank you!! We sure will!!

The Picture Gallery by The Hallwyl Museum (Hallwylska museet) is licensed under
very nice.  I think this one of the best uses of photogrammetry, birnging far away or inaccessible places to others across the world.  I too would like to put in word for annotations.

Are you looking into adding high res images for the paintings?
I've just ported this amazing model to Unity so I could walk&teleport inside of the gallery. I hope you don't mind. I would love to see the paintings in higher detail!  http://id144.org/uploads/VR_TheHallwylMuseum.zip
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!
I like to mess around in Blender and brought it in as a .obj, I've not manage to bring it in completely cleanly but am going to be having many hours pleasure playing with this. Thanks for all your effort:)
Could you please share the brand of camera used, your camera settings and the lens that was used to create this amazing project. Thank you.
Annotations are finally done! @alban @bartv @Larseroo @seori
@bim4d This scan was done with a tripod mounted Panasonic GX8 and a 25 mm lens. Manual exposure 1 sec f8. Lowest possible ISO (200) Glad you like it!
@phantasmagorical Thank you for downloading! We would love to see your results!!
@AndrejBoleslavsky Looks great! Thanks for sharing! Please check annotations for links to hires images of some of the works.
An excellent model - now with an excellent tour :)

The annotations are great and make the most of the online experience - staff pick!
Thank you for providing the tools used to create this AMAZING project.
@nebulousflynn Thanks a lot Tom! Combining content from different platforms and letting them enrich eachother is a simple yet powerful way of making our common cultural heritage more accessible.

You Model fast! Great Work!
It's good, but I think you need to recolor Toy Freddy's pelvis to brown.
the pelvis is sapposed to be light brown
Awesome dude! The colors look a bit to bright, maybe make them a bit darker? ;) Good job tho!

Im gonna guess that Mangle is next :)
i also hope that you can change his eyes to dark
Oh. Nevermind. I just assumed his pelvis was brown because the color looked out of place.
But his hands look a bit small.
man will you put these on steam ever

THis is amazing!!!
very good job ! !!
Model design is nice, but i think you miss a few steps in your workflow.
You should make a high poly version with proper edge creases / subdiv -> bake normals, and then work on your textures, i guess you used Quixel suite for that ? Reminds me that i did the same mistake on a robot a few years ago.
You dont get proper edge wear because of missing normals / cavity maps in the generated materials.
UV seams give some minor edge wear effect though.
It's a cool model that I like to put mocap animations on for fun. Works pretty well.

Maybe should you put a tiny primitive in the center of this environment so that we can be in the center while we turn the head. Not very convenient as it is to appreciate this beautiful piece of environment. Great job by the way :) We're so far from the cubic environments of the first Counter Strike ;)

ship, not the top. The ship has not new textures or how can i say it.......i use only materials which already her. the ship has only stuff from Friedrich and Bismarck.
The reason why am i doing this, is because that there is not an T9 Premium for Germany in World of Warships yet and because i have no experience with bender
and i saw your very good models, i would like to ask you....can i have the Shipmodels to create my ship? i just need them to create my ship with them! 
sure i would like to present the ship to somehow, like the wows community or on You-Tube and hope, that maybe WG see the Design or i can give them some help
somehow. If you dont want to give me the Shipmodels, its not a problem either. it would be easier for me to build it.
i hope we can get an arangement for this

thank you for your time

Trinity
@kaiser_trinity I wish you luck but this modeler and one other actually models the ships for War Gaming/World of Warships. And now I am sure that you know that there are a T9 and T10 BB in the game by this Modeler. 
I wish they were closer to the real plans of the H-39 and H-42 but alas they do work good for the game balance. 

I have written the first volume of a book about German naval history, and the Plan Z ship designs. I am working on the second volume now, which includes the six plan Z Battleship designs and the H-44 design study design. 

You might have more success if you look into WW2 aircraft modeling for War Thunder. I am modeling 2 Japanese float planes that flew from their submarines in hopes to sell them in War Thunder. it is pretty intense modeling though. They do have a guide and a Content Developer program though.

@damonb. I'm not in Rome...all the models are from a recent trip.
Nice job. We visited Rome last year and this was one of my favorite statues. Thanks for making it available.
@rsteven42 You're welcome.
well done! what size is the obj in mm, height for example?
@josephmarr The height of the sculpture is 243 centimetres.
@egiptologo91 Thanks! is that also the height of the obj?
@josephmarr No, the obj is not scaled.
Excuse me, I'm new here, I have dowloaded your 3D image because I need it for a realization of a novel in ebook version, with iBook author. Can I ask you how do you have convert this photo of Apollo and Daphne in 3D version? Did you use Sketchup? I'm trying with ketchup but with no result..thanks!
@Giulia.Maria.De.Luca I have used a program called https://www.bentley.com/en/products/brands/contextcapture. The process to transform images to a 3D model is called photogrammetry. There are lots of programs that do this process.
How many pictures did you need to get this result?
@jumpjack Around 60 photos.
Are you selling this model ?
@Giuseppe.Santillo Not at the moment, sorry.
@egiptologo91 Thanks for the reply!

 I would like to write to you in private.
 would you give me your email?

@Giuseppe.Santillo dani_ortega_molina@hotmail.com
I would love to print this for a schoolproject on the Metamorphoses of Ovidius and specifically Daphne and Apollo, so are you making this available for downloading anytime soon?

Wow, you've reached 5000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

https://sketchfab.com/bartv/collections/followers-milestones
This looks great! 
Are you making the normal map from a high-poly mesh and then putting that on the simplified mesh? If so, which software are you using to retopologise?
@jabaggett Hi, in this case I used RC for both high-poly (15mb) and low-poly (35k). For editing low poly and burning diffusion and normal texture I use 3ds max. For easy retopologise I recomanded Instant Meshes app. For backing aditional textures are very good Knald or Marmoset toolbag...
@3dhdscan Ah good stuff. Thanks for the quick reply! cheers
If only you'll use a roughness map, but still a good render...
I downloaded the rock for a vfx project, i'll send you a link if I upload it (no commercial use of course)
That is one heck of a rock
Quality photogrammetric 3d models for everyone

No joke there, this is both amazing in terms of quality and price! 

Thanks a lot!

Love your work, and very inspired by the quality you achieve. What software do you use? Have you tried both Agisoft and RC? Thank you.
@alemarro Hi, thanks. I use both programs. In most cases, however, I prefer RC. It's faster and better on my HW.

Estimado Vicente, Felicidades por tu gran trabajo el cual estoy seguro ha inspirado y ayudado a muchas personas.
Vicente, considerarias la opcion de permitir el uso de tus modelos anatomicos para relacionar unas imagenes de radiografia? No necesitamos descargarlas ni nada, solo quiero pedir tu permiso para poder mostrarlas por medio de sketchfab y por supuesto que se hara mencion de tu nombre y tu contacto.

Saludos

@ehernan5 hola, te he respondido por privado, o algo así, creo. si no avisame.
I think you've misplaced the radius bone a little, its head is supposed to be lateral to the body, more like here https://sketchfab.com/models/4de7b96a351a4a35b1b6e5415277ff07

Good evening, what a great model of the human body, I wanted to know if you will have it available for download, since I would be very interested in a duty that I have. I look forward to your prompt reply and thank you very much in advance
@AnthonyLeon thanks, I'm glad you like it. Unfortunately i only had permission to show it, nonetheless this model posted here is public, you can take the link and show it wherever you need.
@cae0311 hola, disculpa el tiempo de respuesta ¿a que te refieres con coste del desarrollo? ¿precio por crear este modelo? Esto está dentro de una app de educación ¿precio de desarrollo de la app?
please download
please download :)
how can i download this models?
Great work, but heads up for anyone using this to study anatomy: there is a mistake. The ulna should start medially at the humerus. When the hand is supinated like in this pose, the bones should not cross.
As a result, the forearm muscles are also incorrect. In this pose, the extensors should be most visible from the back, and the flexors from the front.

This skeleton has the forearm bones and muscles placed correctly: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/anatomy-study-11572b0b08cf4d139d79e8e608970667

Ooh! Please make this downloadable!
Thanks everyone! Its all or nothing; no incomplete sets: I'll make it downloadable when I'm done with the rest of the rest of the cast, which should be late December/early January if everything goes as planned.
@the-regressor that's awesome, thanks!
Man, these are all pretty awesome! Though, Papyrus looks... kinda horrifying with the little pinpoints of light in his eyes.
I think Alphys needs one more tooth, too.

But other than that, I love them all - especially Toriel - she's just adorable!
(so the @ is how you reply to someone good to know!)
 Thanks! @Demonskunk  Pap's creepy eyes are intentional; was going with a style less goofy than the game proper.
I simply haven't gotten around to fixing Alphys head shape in general, teeth included.
As for cute Toriel...well...I like making cute things as much as I like making creepy things lol
Thanks for the feedback!
@the-regressor correct. In fact, you can also @-mention people who are not in this conversation and that way they'll get a notification.

Great job on these. You've really nailed that PS1/Dreamcast look.
Thanks @cinebst !
Nice Temmie on the ceiling
I love the Muffet's dress and how it's red instead of purple!
I'm new to modeling and I'm taking a course now, but I really like all of your models! I like how both versions of Undyne look as well as Toriel!
Oh my god, I diddnt know you were on this site too!  Ive been following some of your stuff since around the release of your Papyrus models.

I've always liked the old PSX/N64 modelling style and I love the way that you replicate newer things in that style.
Men. this is so Awsome. I would like to have them.
Can you please put this up for download?These models are really amazing and I really need the Toriel model.Thanks

I would put only 7 light beams instead of 8 to reflect the 7 stars, but that's just me geeking out :p

Great job!
@tiagojdferreira ahh that would have been a good idea! That never occurred to me, I was too busy thinking about filling up the scene. Thanks!

Good job!, looks awesome :D

Excellent work, I gave it a staff pick :)

Which 3D app did you use for this, by the way?
Thank you, Bart. :)

I used mostly Blender and Zbrush, but I also experimented texturing with 3D-Coat and Substance a bit.
Cool. You should add those tools as tags to the model too, we often use them to find art like for my Sketchfab art roundup on BlenderNation. Also, did you know BlenderArtists and ZBrush Central support Sketchfab? Might be worth a post there!
Good points. I will do that.

Did you forget to include the texture?
Hey, I removed the category Products & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
@bartv Indeed, thank you.

I don't even remember why it was in Products&Technology.
Looks pretty cool, but it is not possible to effectively fight with sword like that))) because of too small handle diameter.
@maxim201011 I was going to say something similar to that.
Nice to meet you. I used your wonderful model for my videos. Thank you.

Congrats :)
Hi! awesome character!!! Do you by any chance have her animated too? and would you possibly want to sell it? I'm making a game I would love to have her as the main character :)
This character is Jinx in the game the League of legend. 

it have license. so it can't be used another game. 

sorry;;;
Yes I just figured out that. But it's not a clone/copy of the original one, your even looks better :)
Also I would need to change some stuff.. like shorter hair, remove belt and sidearm, also I could change the weapons.. 

I have been searching for a cute, fun and a bit crazy looking character and this is the best I have seen!!
? :)
Sorry;; I can't sell to you...
:( no problem, thank you for the responce!

Again awesome looking model!!
Wow, fantastic!!!
We loved your work so much that we shared it on social! Hope you get more views!
I love Jinx I just wish this was up for download. I want to print and paint this model I'd do like a 1:6 scale print would be awesome on my desk. :) Love the model she looks fantastic.

better than original
could I please get a download for this model

Really, really beautiful! Keep up the good work!
Great job as always! I especially like the detailed rope and the teeny pawprints. I feel perhaps the moss on the roof may be a little too symmetrical, especially on the side patches, and the dirt outside the door could have more 'texture' when comparing it to how much detail there is in other parts of the model. This is just nit-picking, as overall it's a fantastic bit of work that really captures the quaint feel of the original concept while the added butterflies, ivy and mushrooms help towards making this piece more your own.

I look forward to what you create next, but you've definitely earned a break.
I've featured you on BlenderNation today:

@kimahiri @DANBEE360 @nomadking Thanks a lot!! :)
@Demmy Thank you for your great feedback Dean, it's really helpful! I added a teeny bit of asymmetry to the moss by making it spread out a bit on the bottom parts now! And a little bit of detail on the dirt if you can tell from the first time you've seen it here, even though I have to admit that I wasn't sure how much into detail I should go on that part.. I'll keep that in mind for the next projects and do some dirt studies! Thank you again for liking it!! I'll definitely take a small break now haha :)

Awesome work, I think it turned out great!

What was your technique for hand-painting the model, if you don't mind my asking?
The color scheme is amazing and vibrant.
WOW. Love this.
Probably could drop the mesh density of the eyes, but its really cool.
this style its so unique.
Would have loved to see how the textures were made, great work
Wow, amazing, it looks like a painting. Really nice
This is so beautiful. Ilya's brush work is certainly full of life, but the precision you've applied here has only made it better. Every single angle is a joy to look at. Gorgeous work.

Very nice model, textures and animation. Although I dislike the depth of field effect. Distracts from the content - which is exceptional.

Great..!!!
@paulchambers3d Thank you a lot !
@knuckelhead : The major key is to have a stylized sculpt I think, then, you just have to use a few detailed textures with a subtle opacity.

OMG this is one of the best models I´ve seen.
Hi. Awesome model here, it's quite cool. I love how simple it looks.

By watching your painting style I think you could help me with a problem I have.

I've been modeling this days and I need feedback about the ambient occlusion. How did you do to get that high quiality AO results? I'm using substance painter and my AO baking creates a map that has very low details compared to your model. Did you use any special option or something? Thanks for the feedback and congratulations for your awesome model.
Really clean work. Congratulations !
Awesome piece of work
Nice work! :D

By the way, I thought I'd also staff pick it :)
Dam, I love how you carved out his flesh
@fongoose @Obsidian_dawn 

Thanks! I was more than a little obsessive over the details on this one, so I'm glad it paid off. ;)


@bartv 

I must admit, you've brought out my inner fanboy; I've known BlenderNation since 2007. :D
It's been a pleasant surprise to start my Sketchfab gallery on such a positive note! Much appreciated!
cool. gross. cool. collared shirts are tricky little devils huh? 9/10 here, good job
@jtp360 

Yup. If there's one thing I learned through this project, it's that I need to brush up on texture baking.
Fantastic! I just feel the lower legs have too many wrinkles.
I love it.
Very nice, textures are awesome might I add
awesome!!
Great job Noah ! You gave a very unique style to SlenderMan.
Would you be willing to give the blender rig for free ? :D

I would love to animate this character !
?
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!
Nice job, Noah!, I like the swirly face-skin texture. Also just noticed your emblem on his brass buttons!
The topolgy is outstanding!
@keyle That's the plan! Some interested game developers paid me to finish the project, so I'd like to give them the chance to update their game with the model before I release it myself. I will keep you posted. :)

@seori I noticed! Much appreciated!

@ingramsflight It fits rather well, doesn't it? :D

@BrooklynS9 I'm glad you think so! :)
@Noah Summers
That's awesome ! I'll be happy to hear any updates on that ;)
Congrats !
wow!
Perfect !
eah) looks good
This is really well done.
I need some help. When I import this model as an obj, it wont let me add the skin texture. It just appears black.
@Petiguana The OBJ file only has UV unwrapped geometry with no materials set up.

If it helps, I'm going to record a walkthrough video later tonight showing how to set up the materials in Blender and Unreal 4. I will let you know when it's up. :)

Hey ! I bought the skin in the incentive, you can get a 3D model? I'm a cosplayer and I want to implement it. I promise not to give the model to anyone
@DashaSannikova Nope, sorry i can't give away the model but feel free to use this page for all your cosplay references and thank you so much for your in game purchase :)
Could you at least tell us where you got the model? or how you obtained it?
I've obtained the original model from Digital Extremes but this version is something i've made so you can't get it anywhere else.

We recommended your work for this month's Sketchfab roundup on 3DTotal:

http://www.3dtotal.com/index_news_detailed.php?id=15151&type=2

Enjoy! :)
Wow, thanks alot! :)
Thanks for sharing that was an amazing scene. :)
Only a little question (if you have time). How did you include the lights of your scene in sketchfab? Thaaaank you :)
Hey, I baked the lighting into a second uv channel, which is just an automatic unwrap. If you choose classic shadeless you can pick a second uv channel for the lightmap.
The visual lights, like the candles, are using an emission map. Adding a bit of bloom to the scene makes that shiny. 
I hope that answered your questions.
Sure, thank your. So I understood that you baked the lights on the texture. I didn't understand very well the  If you choose classic shadeless you can pick a second uv channel for the lightmap Did you use 3dsmax and render to texture method? Thank you!
If I may answer this...
pepedrago is refering to one of the rendering choices: Classic Shadeless, as opposed to PBR, or Matcap. In Sketchfab 3D Settings/Scene tab/General/Renderer.
Btw, thanks a bunch for sharing pepedrago :)
Beautiful work! The icing on the cake for me is that when I rotate around the scene, the candle flames seem to flicker. I don't know if that effect was deliberate but it made me extra happy :) Thanks for sharing!
Your model is part of my Artist-Pick, you can read it here: https://forum.sketchfab.com/t/artist-picks-phil-gosch/8246
Congrats, great work! :)
I downloaded this amazing piece but seems the download doesn't come with any texture, is that correct? Or is there a specific way to visualize it and I'm not aware of? (I'm certainly not a pro at this)

Either way your work is simply beautiful and really inspiring, congrats! :)
I also would like to download this model, but I'm having the same issue as DIH (no textures included with the downloadable version). Would you be able to upload a downloadable version of the model that includes the textures? Thank you!
hey, here's the diffuse texture http://imgur.com/ysbtBED
The lightmap uses a second uv.
Cheers.
I would like to talk to you about possible freelance work - would you be able to provide your email?
I can't find your email - would you be able to send me an email regarding freelance work? noveltyfalcon@gmail.com

Your art is awesome! You are a great inspiration for me :D
Yasss Gawd this is gorgeous, gurl!
Nice!
Really nice!
Could you give more details about the normals issues you had with animated blendshapes by mail at support@sketchfab.com?
We still have issues with normals and morph animation and these details will help us to spot and fix the issue.
Thanks!
Perfect animation. Perfect everything.
Amazing work! I love the animation!
Pretty cool :)
Awesome
@waleguene Sure! that would be helpful, I'll send some detailed info, thanks for the fast response :)
Some of the best character animation I've seen on Sketchfab. Superb!
ijoles Carlos! Esta requete bonito el modelo y la animacion <3
Pretty awesome that is mate. :D
Very lovely facial animation.

I checked out the rig on gumroad. Is everything bone-driven in the final export we see here? :)
@pod Thank you! the facial rig is blendshape based :(  I actually ran into some problems exporting here woth some deformers and correctives, but lesson learned .
How come this Bunny girl doesn’t have a tail?
GOLD!
I usually avoid furries at al cost but the animation on this one is so smooth that I'll make an exception.
Any chance we could get the dl link again?

Liam.. lovely.

note - underneath the dorsal fin is transparent, so when you look down on goldfish you can see through to outside.
it's cool man :-)
Literally best fish model I've ever seen.
Absolutely spectacular texturing work!
Increible!
Beautiful!
oohhh´   excelente´´
Are you using non-mirrored UVs for the normal map, to avoid seams, and using mirrored UVs for the rest of the maps to save texture space?
Amazing man. WOW
Amazing
@d4psa : Good Eye! Thats exactly what I'm doing with the extra UV channel. One channel for non-symmetrical textures and the second for symmetrical ones. It ends up saving quite a bit of texture space, especially when you start applying it to everything in a scene.

Waou!!! Superb model!!! We love it! One small detail though, if the mouth is closed after swallowing water, the gills should open to expel the water and absorb the air and than the mouth opens again ;-)

Very creative, nice detail. I clicked on the new download button, but no texture is included :(
@jwilcott I noticed that too, I'm not sure if the download doesn't come with textures, or the textures need to be packed along with the model when uploading. The textures used here are added after uploading.
@jwilcott I just checked the FAQ, the textures need to be packed with the model. I will re-upload once I'm done with the texturing, the flamer and the pipes aren't finished yet.
@patrix ok cool!
Uploaded textures, the download file should have textures now :)
wow this is really great. thanks for uploading the textures. I really like colors you put in the specular map. it ages the metals perfectly.
@jwilcott Thanks! The texture are still WIP though, still needs a lot of refining. And I'm planing on adding flames, rain drops and a background scene.

@paulchambers3d 

Hey Paul, no problem! Thanks! :)
ah, I had the same idea.
Congratulations, you'll become rich now. ;)
@redy 

Hahaha, thanks man! :D
Looks great! How can I put clothes on this model though? I'd like to purchase it
@adamkareem Hi Adam, I've commissioned additional props/clothing to models. They usually cost higher than the model itself due to the work involved, but let me know if you're interested :)
@murilo.kleine thanks for getting back! I love your work in general, besides clothes for this model, do you do commissions much? What's your rate? 

I've been making some fan games in Unreal (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Nm07Q0vzIMCKDXGaKCcqHxSpvReYrvG) and I'm considering replacing them with original IP at some point. 

Also, side question: have you used VROID studio much? It's an anime character creator
@adamkareem 

Thanks, man! ;D

I'm working full time atm, so bigger commissions are tough. It would depend on what you need, though.
Add me on ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/murilokleine it's easier to chat there, you can explain what you have in mind and I can give you an estimate of time and costs. ? 
I've never used VROID, it seems interesting, I'll take a look.

Thanks Adam!
The model is great ... can I ask what kind of material is used? Besides textures, I don't know how to achieve a similar or similar render ... especially on the skin
@gabito950 
Hi Gabito, it depends on the engine/software you're using, although, in this case, it's using a pretty basic light setup and shader.

The model comes with full body textures with some slight shading, you can check it selecting Base Color mode on the model inspector here on Sketchfab. (it's the layer icon on the bottom menu). I hope it helps :)
null
i know this sounds dumb.
 but if you rig for udk(ue3) basic player anim

or even ue2 basic player anim
and i'm sold :D

if you want to make a totally new set of those, 
mocked so it can be used in a deathmatch / capture the flag / + game type, that is ok too.
but it would be faster just to use those engines' generic animations. :D
What version of blender was this made with? I'm not sure if your materials translate properly in 2.8
finally got it to work. 
1) the current .blend's materials break in blender 2.81, import the gltf instead
2) if you import the gltf, the lighting sources are turned into empties, which means you have create 2 sun lights and copy the transforms of the empties to the new sun lights.
@rothran.agnos1218 Thank you for the help!

This is not very nice to make it unloadable. But even if it is, there is not much use of it. Otherwise, great job!

great textures. Paint in Blender is a bit too hard to me without layer options.

haha this reminds me of that time the doctor told me i had an skeleton inside of me, it was like ???????????????????????? No that's not true, then my wife told me she had one inside of her.
I was shocked, had to take that wicked thing off of her as soon as we arrived home.
Dude, you are DE BEST
the model is fantastic, the camera aim could be more where the model is. it's hard to rotate around it on the macbook.

Hey Loïc, thanks a lot for sharing your amazing collection and making it freely downloadable! 
Just wanted to give you a heads-up that I think another user stole your dataset (without attribution): https://sketchfab.com/models/3ade5ff940cb4f14b3c48fbfff14d12c 

I've reported the model to Sketchfab for review - hopefully they take it down :)
@ubi3d Thanks very much for the info, and your kind comment.
The user did not really stole the dataset as it is under CC-Attribution (so re-upload is OK...): let's indeed say he/she has just forgotten the Attribution part... 
Plus this model was shared on a Facebook page dedicated to architecture a while back (with credits this time), and the user might have downloaded it from there, not knowing it came from Sketchfab: I've just posted a comment to ask him/her for credits !
I'm just sad that dear Waldo was replaced by a plain white rectangle in the other model ;)
Super nice :) 

Thank you very much.
Hi Loïc, I used some of your lowpoly people on this project: https://skfb.ly/6GDzP 

Thanks again for the wonderful dataset (so many nice models to choose from)!! I'm sure I'll use them again in the future :D
Hi Loic :-)
Could you upload the file again ? the Zip file seems to be corrupted.

This is brilliant ! It looks gorgeous on my phone. I wasn't even aware that sketchfab could handle point clouds.
it's great. thank you.

it's a point-cloud.  in blender, you can view/convert it with this addon:

C'est bien bien classe. Well done !
@Dradhil @chakib2456 @timothius Thanks for your nice feedbacks guys !

@daniol You're very welcome. That addon looks dope by the way: point clouds in blender ? I'm in for that :D

@moltenclouds @RockRun Thank you for your nice comments guys !

@menatoorus I feel very flattered: thanks for logging in and letting me know, your words are very appreciated :)
wow amazing :o
?
This is hands down the best model I've ever seen! 

A question; is ply or gltf convertable to OBJ?
@spenteman @diyarovalen ?

@defiant_pottato Wow, I'm glad you liked it so much! 

You could usually convert those formats to OBJ files, but OBJ is not meant for point clouds, and will lose the color information anyway... 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that if the software you wish to use cannot read the PLY file in the first place, you probably would therefore not have more chance with OBJ...
null
@norgeotloic 
yea, obj is more usable, anyway ya model is awesome
I have to admit that I don't even come close to understanding the programming you used to produce this work of art. Glad you figured it out. Just saying thanks again :)
wonderful work!
@sdun thank you!

Very beautiful work!
Am brand new to this community. Very nice dragon. Am in the Explore stage. You are my first download. I use iClone Pro 6 and am awaiting iClonePro7 release; was referred to Sketchfab via iClone Webinar. I used to have an older version of Blender but that was on an old computer; I think am ready for Blender2013 download or latest download. I also use the Creative Commons licensing at www.youtube.com

And congratulations to YOU for this very precise and inspiring scan in the first place ;)
Wow, nice work mate!! Great job on that glass, stunning!
Dope!
How did you get the ship inside the bottle??? :D
@cie @CGArtem Thank you guys :)
@henryk If you look closely at the bottom of the bottle, you'll see a round seam. Well, that's actually not a sign of my poor UV seams (definitely not), but the direct consequence of me cutting the bottle to insert the boat ;)
@henryk I love that comment! ??

This is amazing work ! The way this is presented it and the fact it is downloadable makes it a perfect lesson/task for anyone learning any render engine - just try replicating the result shown here :D 
@Sketchfab indeed has some nice technology running back there :)
Nice model, only glass is maybe too much distorded. So if you put so much effort to put ship inside bottle, next time find some better bottle ;)
@bojidarkn Good idea, this would indeed be a very good exercise to learn using fancy materials (clear coat, opacity...).
Thank you for your very motivating comment, and as playing with refractive materials seems to give great results, I'll probably experiment some more in the next months and could try to keep your educationnal spirit in mind to provide more information, that could be really useful to some I guess!

@alekba Hehe... I actually struggled with that one, and the distorsion is indeed a bit too much. If you ever played with refractive materials recently, I hesitated a lot between using the normal offset option to keep the main part of the bottle more realistic - at the cost of its opening not distorting light enough - and not using this option to create a nice refraction at the opening and handles, which would have had the effect of confusing the brain in the main part of the model... I could probably try using two distinct materials, that could work...
Plus the normals on the bottle are indeed a bit too pronounced, but I won't look for better bottles until later though, as I'm still very proud of this one ;)
Thanks for your feedback :D

I want to use this for VRChat but i do not know how to lower polys.
@Terrascale the overall vertices count is 41 773 in blender,
I can't help much in your task, I remarkably added IK rigging to the original model with the ability to export the IK armature and the animations to Unity as Humanoid (which wasn't a simple task as far as I researched)
here is a link to the original model, you will find it lower poly than mine

Oof, nevermind was looking at the wrong file lol
Excellent model! I'll be using this for practice
@nocturnealist thanks a lot, hope it would be of help to you

Good work. Thank you So much!
@darkhorsepaintball just up the poly limit on the sdk
how enable her Eyes ? If i remove Eye_panch she dont have eyes
@Nokreb you were right, I don't no how I missed it, anyway it simple to add them, justadd a new sphere, UV unrap it to fit the eye in the face texture and the rest is to fit it, mirror it and parent it to the last spine bone (not the head rigify bone)
I re-uploaded the model it they should appear now
@kishiman thanks !
Is it compatible with blender 2.8?
I'm using 2.8 beta and I'm having some trouble with the bones, it can't be moved.
@dog012 I tested it in 2.8 and yes the the main IK rigging bone shapes haven't been imported, the bones are still there yet invisible and can't be selected,
I recommend re-rigging it the model within blender 2.8, the rigify addon has been ported since the early releases and it works properly.
Can you teach me how to use rigify in blender 2.8?
@dog012 Sorry for my mistake, it apears I was using rigify in 2.79, I was testing it in 2.8 and it is still buggy. However if you want to learn about how to exploit rigify to the best, I recomend watching this video from the blender conference 2018
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txJ-2zUQSTg
null
I think rigify is not quite stable in 2.8 beta now, probably have to wait for the official release.
By the way, I can't open the file in 2.79 either.
Thank you !

no problem

Love it. Especially the tracks. :)
Very nice model i realy love it but i have question. 
caterpillars are subject to gravity ?
And is that a copy of the KV-2 world of tanks?
@holfy
@holfy thank you, Did'nt quite get the question about tracks, if you mean, are they physical object, then - no, i just made them hanging to visualize tension. And for the second question, this model was made using blueprints and photoreferences of the real WW2 tank, and has no connection to the Worlf of tanks game whatsoever.
@comrade1280 Ok nice job for that i have a last question this object are in free use or not ?
@holfy Absolutely free :)
Just wanted to let you that this was featured on CGChannel's August Best Sketchfab Models of the Month! Congrats!

http://www.cgchannel.com/2016/08/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-august-2016/
Really amazing job :D
Love all the detail you gave to it, all the screws, exhaustion grids of engine, even the guner aiming sight :D
The tracks and the suspension are amazing as well.
You  even made the barrel stretch marks!
I'm in love with this model!
I'm also trying to make this little beast but it's based on the 1939 model.

Overall, a giant thumbs up for this :)
@filipelobo 
Thank you very much, i'm glad to be of any help if needed :)
Is it possible you upload a printable version? with details, just no barrel marks and etc you can't print. And separate the hull and turret if you do that.
Beautiful gun! Great job!

Thank's man, nice simple mesh to save me some time. Really appreciate it. :)
Nice low poly mesh but couldn't use it it was the wrong format for c4d. Would have been nice like eneash said to save some time. Keep up the good work.
would love to use this for testing, any way to get this setup with a skeleton?
Beautiful! You should keep doing these :D
How to download it ? :)
Thank You!
If i use this I'll probably modify the heck out of it to make it fit the style of my game but i'll be sure to credit you
This is absolutely perfect! I am so excited to use this as a base character for my game! Ill be coming back for some more amazing models in the future! Don't worry, you will be credited!

Thank you so much, James.
Yes, I've changed the settings according your advises (texture 4000x4000, Shadeless, and Sharpness: On), and the appearance improved lots.
Please let me know if you find any points to improve.
Also, we have our project page on facebook (https://www.facebook.com/shipsofdiscovery/?fref=nf&pnref=story), please check this if you are interested in maritime archaeology.
Thanks again!

You even got under the wing! Nice job.
@jenmck13 Really impressive 3d scan. I guess you made this with photogrammetry? What camera did you use and how many pictures?

Thanks, Matthew, Geoffrey, and Ho4uK,
I used Agisoft Photoscan (Photogrammetry software) and Nikon D7100 with Ikelite underwater housing.
And 1624 photos were taken for this model :)
Great work, love the swimmer addition. Just added to my collection of great underwater scans.
awesome!
again, awesome!
Impresionante.

Hi Christophe,

thanks for participating in the World of Tanks Diorama contest! Together with the Wargaming team we'll be picking the winners on Wednesday. Until then, you should try to get as many views and likes on your model as you can - they are included in the judging process. Consider posting your model on Facebook or Twitter, and sharing it with your own World of Tanks communities, or on other game design communities.

The final selection will be announced on Thursday. Good luck!!
Nice visual :)
bravo ! belle realisation !

@scrampunk @INNOK Thank you! :)
Just updated the artwork with a few fixes and improvements, i.e. flowers on the lady's left hand, her right finger movements, and texture on their feet. :)
@hinxlinx I watched this for 5 minutes just taking it in, and I'll likely come back to it every now and then for further viewing - mindblowing interpretation! Seriously amazing stuff.
@scrampunk Thank you for the praise. I keep looking at it and keep finding more stuff to fix! :)
Great work! Congrets!

This is really great work! One of my favorite ships (slightly behind Serenity). This is very well done.
lovely model is there any way of being able to purchase this or download it perhaps?  It would provide a perfect starting point for a short future marvel fan project :)

Nice job! Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2? It's so good! I'm sorry this just reminded me of it lol!
I wanted to use this for a couple month project.  Wanted to see if I could get the model or, get another instance with a different background?  Of course pay for the use, and assistance.

Great image! I featured it on BlenderNation last January.
I always wanted to buy one of those on ebay. My initial idea was to embed an ipad instead of the screen, and make a touch macintosh :) Congrats on the 20k views milestone btw! I hope to see more of your work here :)

Amazing capture. The details are enviable.  Just how did you capture such a shiny object.  I can't imagine you dusted it with powder, it seems that would hide the detail etchings.
Thanks a lot @Larseroo No powder involved :) Keeping the lighting as flat and even as possible does the trick! You´ll get a glimpse of the rig in the first clip you encounter if you scroll down a bit in this article. https://blog.sketchfab.com/three-sweedish-museums-experiments-photogrammetry/

Love this.
Man, that's so awesome. The simplicity and the textures... just wow. I would love to turn your model into a papercraft diorama, fjrebolledo@uc.cl can you email me the model, please????
this could never be a game because the units cant move on top of the buildings.
it works in 2d, but this wont work in 3d
why are we not funding this
@timeiskey - you could just have the units disappear and have some kind of marker appear to show you have a unit on a building
@James ive seen a couple games do it. it looks bad. So far nobody has come up with a good way to do this in 3d.
i suspect you could get away with forcing all units onto the top of the zbuffer, but then you have other issues.
Might be ok with an isometric perspective (tactics)
Hi,

@katharii included your work in his Artist Picks on the forum:

Good job.

One of my favourite games as a kid, amazing!
Thanks for all the nice comments!!!

Amazing stuff, makes me wish they made a new one in 3d!

Ya, I'm working on a baked lighting version. But anything is better than the default lighting in Sketchfab :)
Terrific!
why not make the water slightly opaque? + you have some wall textures upside down, resulting in some obvious seems, just so you know. Good job on the scene
The reason for that is because it gives some zdepth errors conflicting with the foam. Else I'd have done it.
famously
perfectly

We have some big updates to our lighting features coming soon, so stay tuned!

@fen4ik Hey, I dont use 8k textures, i try to keep with using on 2k textures, but depending on the level of detail and the size, i either go for a procedural workflow using floating decals (mainly for vehicles etc) or i break up the object into different shader groups. Either by selecting regions or by material type, whichever works better.
PERFECT
but i dont buy this model because i dont have PayPal :*(
@lundgren.play Could always setup a Paypal (Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge)
Unfortunately, I can not achieve such clarity on my 3D models in the presentation, as you have
@fen4ik You can if you use 4x 2048 textures sets.

Hello, @YAN2017 . I love your work, it's so beautiful. Can I download her to do a render with one of my modeling projects, please?. I think they can look really cool together.
Well done modelling and coloring her! This is really great texturing!
You should really work on a video game.
Wow cool Mid Poly

@roymj Why specify? Because physiologically, different races have very different facial bone structures. It's quite easy to tell the race of the person a skull belongs to, for instance if trying to solve a missing persons case. Why choose Caucasian specifically? Idk, they had to choose something...

Just wondering though, in the wire frame you seem to have modelled glasses? But these don't show, is this intentional? :)
@mar-3d  Many of others dont't like this model wearing glasses, So i hid her glasses :v 
And if you want to see, you have to download my model.

Excellent work! I'm giving this a staff pick.
Maybe do a biplane some time...
Congrats! We picked your model for the Monthly Picks on CGChannel:

http://www.cgchannel.com/2016/04/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-march-2016/
Great one! I really like the style.
@kryik1023 Nice one! Did you painted metal panels in SP or baked them from high-poly?
amazing
Really, really pretty. Love the normals!
Thanx.........But i can not open it in maya 2016.........I learn modeling.
An great plane
great plane!! downloading now..thanks!
That is some very impressive work for a first attempt at a plane very nice and way to switch things up from cars what a twist
keep up the good work looking forward to more form you
Thank u so much, very nicely done.Good example for freshers.
Awesome model! almost alive!
Very beautiful
This makes me happy
A spitfire with a fully feathered prop? in the air?
And a loose tailwheel
excellent build
Hello,

There is an error on the plane.
It has wings of Spitfire MK9 and against it has pots Spitfire exhaust MK5.
So there is a mix of both versions.

Thank you
Looks dope :O 

Could've gone with higher res textures tough
looks great, only one thing missing that would make it complete....the glass canopy where the pilot is....should be bubbled...the trademark of spitfires
Looks awesome...

No, as it's a part of a bigger project. 

Sorry =/
Bummer. What is the best one you have come across online?
The best reference was the Venator from ep3 ( take some screenshots ), for this toon version, the clone wars series are a good tool to observe all you may need to create your own venator, but I've also used the custom Lego build made by Iomedes, as it provides some nice and logical details on turrets and strategical points ( I love the reactors =D ), check it out here : http://www.themarysue.com/lego-star-destroyer/

Honestly, and I'm not saying mine is the best one you'll find on the web, but all other fan made models I found don't made the trick for me. Sometimes they had too much details not everywhere on the model, sometimes proportions are wrong or feel wrong, or texturing is bad, etc. So...if you can, take some time to do it yourself ! =D I've done mine in two weeks working only after work so 2-5 hours a day ( and it was really pleasant =) )
Now is this model going to be downloadable? either way can this model be implanted into game engines such as with the unreal engine? I would really love to know.
Still not downoadable, and really no suitable for any game engine. I mean, you may get it with its maps and so on, but the mesh could be waaaaaaay better optimized for it if you want to have thousands of it into the same scene, just take a look at the face count here, double it cause here you've got mainly polygons, not triangles, and look closely at the Venator's surface, imagine that all details could be baked into a normal map ^^ For the center part with all glowing windows I don't know for now how I would get a better optimisation without sacrifying the global shape, honestly it's a model I plan to remake one day, I just don't know when.
Cool model just wish it was downloadable
You should consider making this available to download. I have a 3d printer and would love to print something like this to put one my desk. 
I imagine a great many others would like to print something like this to!
null
this is very impressive
@blackcatmignon i thought it was actually from the clone wars series
@FilipAAOfficial Well, no. I've spent hours of hard work on it, no matter if it means less nowadays, but it's a ressource that needs to be sold in order to be used away from the project it came from. 

You can make your own or go to another site for having a Venator ( no matter if it come from clone wars art direction or not ), like turbosquid or any other one ( I found this one : http://www.3dcadbrowser.com/download.aspx?3dmodel=94265 )
@Doci As far as I know I'm the only one who has made this model. That's enough to sell at least the work time I spent on it. No one should ever work for free, but you're right as I don't have star wars license, so if it has to be sold one day it would not benefit of it in its price. 

But anyway, I won't sold it so don't worry about an eventual risk of licensing ^^
i found some goofs when i puzzled it together. alot of the t-shapes are broken and the turrets got some holes. it's easily said that it's one of the better looking models tho. looks nice without bumpmaps. it creates correct surface shadows. might wanna also thank for the space in the uv map. that may be needed to add the inside of the hangars. when i have time. ^_^
@betatester Show off what you can do and try to deal with this model guy, it's stupid and useless to use a work that don't belong to you with an art direction you just don't understand...I can't believe what I've read, I thought the community here was clear from that kind of minds...I'm disapointed.

I'm asking to the sketchfab team what th hell is that and if it's normal to have almost an open sourced lobrary of all content posted here I'll simply delete my account, btw sorry to all the followers I've had =(
wtf. nobody wants you to leave. rather the opposite. i'd like to assist your game project if i'd have time and resources. and the skillz to paint or design this style. i'm a fan of clone wars too. ofc i collect the good stuff. it is just that. nothing bad gonna happen. :)
Ow...sorry so aside I'm not a fan of the ripping state of mind that's a kind idea that you wants to help me, but as I said to many fans that reached me, it's not that you're bad, it's not that I don't want to work with you, it's just that it's a star wars project so a project that could be fired by disney or EA or whoever has the IP license and as much money to take it down. If you want to lose time by working on an already dead project ( I'm over pessimist, yep ), do it yourself but I don't want to force others to lost their time on it. Btw I guess it would be better to work on other things that I didn't do such as a new planet, characters, etc and maybe one day we could merge both projects. I'm already working on all the interior into ue4 so doing those hangars isn't good if you want to create somthing that fit to the project.
You should put this on the store. I mean it! It's AWESOME, and I'm willing to pay! P.S. If you are still working on the project, you should use Unity.
@magiccoder59 I do not want to have any issue with rights holders so selling this is no planned for the moment.

PS : I'm still working on the project but for many reasons, even if I had to start a new project, Unity won't be my choice.

Hello, manuelfuentes13! My name is Dmitry, and I student from Univercity of Architectural and civil Engineering (speciality - engineer-builder). My diploma project is analysis building construction of Yoyogi Centre by Kenzo tange. For all dimensions i need architectural model for more accurate analyse.
I not have a lot of time and instruments to draw similar model.  I wanted to ask you give me that model for (only!, not commercials!) educational purposes.  (? want to convert this model from stl to dwg format)
Its very interesting building analyse construction  with two large steel cables [13” in diameter] are supported between two structural towers in addition to being anchored into concrete supports on the ground!!!

Wow look at the faces count. My browser has trouble showing it
Great model. But weak concept. i.e. has too many weak points. Also cable connection from the bottom to leg better to be 90 deg angled (now it's bent).
Perfect concept and model but the DOF is very annoying.
@balmor3d agree dof is annoying when looking around at the model , model itself is dope :D
Thanks all !

Sorry @balmor3d and @han, I've just saw your comments. I agree with you and I've removed the DOF. In any case Thanks ! :D
I am just wondering if this is a real machine or animation 3d model ! all parts ( joints, hydraulic absorbers, rubber pipes.....and metal substance as well) move like real. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ouch O_o
ow
mantap soul sahabat simad
Looks awesome. Alhough I wonder if big pistons control the feet and knees then how those tiny little pistons have the power to move whole leg. :P I know I'm too picky.
Indeed, really well done and cool design.
@kyan0s what of dof or depth of field? what did you remove?? I'm lost.
Nice robot, it looks like unit from Iron Harvest - game !
Is this your house? reflected in his viewing glass))
Great model. However, something is lacking consistency and make it lose credibility. 
Your model has a look of a WW2 tank with heavy metal legs and body, so it must weight tons of pounds but the hydraulic cylinders at the joins look way too thin to support all the weight and would not walk that easily (even if it was a toy, the hydraulic system would not resist a day!). 

You might want to adjust or find another stronger hydraulic system to make it credible. 
See what I mean here: https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/168805/2613118-8400644321-Light.jpg

Make it feel it could walk for years and could even walk faster because of a very strong, resistant and agile walking system.
@aimetribolet what's the game featured from the link of the tank you posted?

Should study the real ones.
7K faces?! Truly impressive!! i need to update my models.. If you can model a perfect T-rex using only 7K faces, I should be able to make a lamp without breaking 400K faces :-O
very good! i suggest doing another version that is feathery like the real tyrannosaurus
can i have this model for download
Nice Awesome looking!
7k quad ! really cool ! 

Do you sell it? can you rig and animate it ? :)
Very well done!

The model looks totally awesome!
Any chances you might add download for it?
I like what you did with the stripper clip.
When I upload this model to Unreal engine 4 it is imported as many different individual pieces and skeletons. How do I fix this?
@Smith597 If you just want to drag it into UE4 as-is with clip and bullets you can tick combine meshes in the FBX import options pop-up in UE4.

If you want JUST the gun as a static mesh you would need to open up the FBX, OBJ or .MB in a 3D editor and remove the bullets from there export it out and do the same as above.

Hope that helps.
@fappar Thank you! That does help a lot! Also, I appreciate the quick response!

nice texture work
Awesome!
Amazing!
Awesome texture paint ! I love her work, your render absolutely stick to the style :)
Frikkin' awesome! Very impressed.
I like this a lot! But this texture painting style that really became dominant with Blizzard's World of Warcraft is getting a bit old. I have great appreciation for replicating the style but it looks to me like the same texture artist is creating like 40% of all of these types of 3D elements. I know the maxim: create what you want to see created. I'd best get busy! Great work though!
You're definitely good. I hope you found a job. I personally really like the choice of colors in your textures :) Keep up !
Beautiful details
So beautiful
This is really true to the original. Interestingly I'm in the same position, trying to find a concept art to make into 3D for a class. Thanks for showing me Catell-Ruz!
TOP!
low poly model it looks too good
I love the haphazard style of the building! with all the little bits of detail sticking out!

@wulongti 
Thank you for your comment Christian! I took a month and a half beetween my work and my family to achieve this piece. I hope i will find some time to do other sculpts like this one?
Incredible style and nice details! I love it!
Great Twist. Excellent work.
Hey I have a deal for you, please contact to me on skype: deathnon0214
I love the attention detail you've given this: the stitching coming undone at the shoulder for instance is so subtle and just makes it look so much more tense. Love it. Well done.
With the look on her face she reminds me more to Lieutnant Engel from Wolfenstein then Black Widow. No criticism my friend. It`s a good model.
How do i purchase this?
This model is now downloadable ?

It's a beautiful scene. Particularly the lighting. Would love to award this a Staff Pick but it needs further optimization. If possible I encourage you to merge all meshes that share the same material and re-upload.
Hi @paulchambers3d 
I've tried to merge all the similar meshes, particularly the rocks (resulting from a particule system I've converted) and the result is quite astonishing:
My file size increased from 27Mo to almost 150Mo! (with the same number of polygones)
I've just spent the last 2 hours looking for a solution, and it seems (maybe I'm wrong) that the reason for that is that all those rocks are actually instances of the 4 original meshes I've used to create my particule system.
So when I merge the result of this conversion into one big mesh, all instances are also converted, which might explain the size.
Here is a topic that certainly explains the problem better than I do: http://blenderartists.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-324536.html

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'll be able to find a good way to optimize this scene correctly... But thank you so much for the almost staff pick :)
Hey Aurélien - I'm curious - even though the file size was much larger, did you try and upload as a test? Even though the file is bigger it should still be better optimized for draw calls.
Hey @paulchambers3d 
You were absolutely right!!! I've just uploaded this modified scene as a draft and it's perfectly fluid :) I'm gonna re-upload it! I'll tell you when it's online. Many thanks!!
Great to hear! May be time for a Sketchfab blog post, but in short, every time a GPU identifies an object with an individual material, it has to make a draw call back and forth from GPU to screen. This takes milliseconds. By identifying all meshes that share a common material and combining them, suddenly 100 individual calls can be combined into 1 draw call. Turning a scene with several hundred calls into one with just 4 or 5. Even though the file size has increased because instances are now individual points in space, the actual number of vertices being drawn on screen at render time are the same whether they are instanced or not.
Amazing work on optimizing! Very pleased to be able to award a much deserved Staff Pick!
BTW - I went ahead and set the scene scale for you in VR. It looks AMAZING! Don't forget to set VR settings for all your models. Learn more here: https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/211640363-VR-Editor
Thank you very much @paulchambers3d!!
I've just finished re-uploading and re-creating the materials which had totally disappeared! For a better result, no doubt! And I'm totally amazed by the fluidity. So once again, thanks a lot for the help and also for the real staff pick this time :)
@paulchambers3d  I wish I had a VR headset to give it a try... And next time I'll set VR settings for sure ;) See you
Beautiful work, thank you so much for this generous contribution to artists on the internet!

Hey Merzel, below your model viewer in Sketchfab, just click on settings > annotations. Easy :) Cheers
@aurelien_martel 
awesome thanks for the fast answer. That explains a lot! Do you have any idea how this guy got the red lines into the picture apart from the annotations?

:)
@merzel 
You're welcome :) No doubt he included them into his model before importing it in sketchfab. These are just bezier curves converted into meshes in Blender.
@aurelien_martel 
hey aurélien, thanks for your answer! But actually I couldn't find out until now how to do these bezier curves in a away that they follow the surface of my modell in a similar way as in the link below
. do you have an easy suggestion? thank you

Also, when I try to render it, everything becomes pink. Do any of you know how to fix that? I'm sorry, I'm new to blender.

This is Mind Blowing! Awesome work!
ok no hate but you obviously dont know how cars move or work with how when they turn theyre suspension gets bent so the car leans outwards from the turns direction. (amoke from tires burning too but I know why you didnt I think)
@alexlabon6 Hello, if you look closely, you will see that the transfer of force is done correctly. It is quite light because the suspension is hard. But this animation is a simulation recording, the physic engine is really configurable & very efficient ! Best regards.
@sa3d *facepalm*
Spectacular work! I would like to propose a custom mid-engine car design. Can you render it for me? I would like to know if you are more comfortable rendering a car design off of reference images or if you can render it based on description so we can easily produce an accurate model.

Banzai or Bonsai ?! 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_thousand_years#Japan
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai
Actually both wrong. Big curved tree is not bonsai.
You're right, if i'm correct about this: bon means pot and sai means plant, so bonsai only applies for potted trees.

Thanks for letting my know.
it's very cool, with the bridge it reminds me of a miniature version of the bath house in Spirited Away. reckon it would look amazing with some highlight fx in Unreal4 engine
Thanks, I love that movie. :)
Ok Christophe, not bad. I'm happy to see this and you got a staff pick.
There are some things you can improve
- Background, add more athmosphere and loose some of the grey by adding a custom background.
- Nature on the rocks, I would really like to see some grasses and mosses on the rocks and preferable in different hues of green than the tree.
- Stone wall and rock face, these textures can improve a bit, it is still a little simple.
- Tops of the big wooden beams should be unwrapped to a more suitable bit of wood texture.
A lot of unnecessary polygons
Wow this looks so amazing and very detailed. Super life like and very nice textures! :)
How long did it take you to do the modeling?
I like how he's made a lot of the detail with 'unnessecary polygons' and not through some kind of normal like a bump mapping, it just gives it even more character in areas like the roofing tiles for instance. it's simple where it need's to be and detailed where it means to be, all things considered it's well thought out
Thank you all for the great feedback.
I changed the background and added some moss on the rocks.

I hope it looks better then before.

@LouDanum: Thank you very much. I am glad to read that!
Awsome tutorial, very easy to follow along with and very detailed. 
Followed a lot of tutorials but i keep comming back to this , looking forward to the texturing chapters :) Great work!
started modeling a few months ago now and i picked up this tutorial on steam , it was easy to follow along , it has everything you need from reference pics, a custom script and all the custom hotkeys i learnt a lot and do not regret a single £ i spent .
the only complaint i have is that i forgot the hotkeys a lot at first so i what constantly going back to look at the basics in 3d models video , i think you could improve by saying the hot key as you press it as there was some hot keys you where using that where not explained , i don't think it is too much to ask as it is £27 
but saying that it is worth the money i would highly recommend it to anyone hows starting out or even if you have been modelling for a few years , this tutorial has inspired me to make my own models at the same quality as i have learn all the skills needed to 
thanks
I'm adding this to my Guns! collection!
Fantastic! Is it live, or is it Memorex!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Tim! Great work with this. I'm currently following on your grenade tutorial, but I can't wait to finish that and buy your AK tutorial to sink my teeth into.
Most realistic AKM i've found on Sketchfab (2016)
I followed your tutorial and made my own heckler and koch mp5 3D model :) really happy and grateful to you, You're my isnpiration. i want to be a pro weapon modeler like you :') I hope so i am from pakistan and there is not even a single institution in my country which is providing so much knowledge and experience. Thank you so much

Very nice
Hi! 2$ is a not FREE download:)

I paid for this tutorial on your website and it was easily worth EVERY cent. I feel like a better modeler, thank you for all of your help! :)
Hi Tim!
I very surprised by the attention to detail in this model. When I served in the Russian army, I dismantled such a machine gun. ?? and ?? is very cool! But why is wood material red?
By the way a very tutorial! Spasibo))

This is fantastic in VR. I love your color choices and you overall composition.
Very nice work!  Agree with vibrantnebula the color composition sets off the whole piece.

Did you make this in Maya or Blender (just curious ^^)  Following you from now :D
@vibrantnebula Thanks a lot! I hope I can see it in VR some time too!
@arun02139 Thank you! I created it with Blender and Photoshop :)

Nice work! However I cleaned up your categories a bit, see our guidelines:
https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines

Specifically I removed the Cultural Heritage & History category:
Objects, artefacts and visualisations directly related to the history of life on Earth and intended for the education and instruction of viewers in the field of cultural heritage.

If you can add some historical & educational context (info, links, images) to this model then please add it back to the CH&H category :)

@araon I actually had the thought, hey, this could be a fun little Garry's Mod/Source Filmmaker map, when I saw this, so while I don't personally think this quite fits the Half-Life 2 aesthetic, it certainly has that feel the game gives you.

Amazing work either way though, uvnik~!
Good job !
I am really impressed.Great job
this is gorgeous
kinda looks like that one map on Call of Duty, forget which one, but it definitely looked very similar.
wow amazing!
@Gho57X90 , thanks for your warm comment. I am very glad that you really liked my scene

@nataliak Thank you Natalia! Btw. I always set tags and category during upload but it seems to not work for some reason. I always have to go back later and add it afterwards.
Ah! @bitgem so, this is actually a bug that we...JUST FIXED! So it should work as of now. When you upload and set tags, they will be saved. :)
This is so awesome! I hope that someday I'll have this level of skill.

@bartv Hey  Bart, I'll try to do something nice when i'll get the time, right now things are kind of busy§ But it's a good idea :)
5,000! ?
this is amazing!
@korblborp Thanks !

 @bartv Hey bart, great news ! Don't worry, i'm working right now on a model for this, sorry for the delay I had some issues this past months so I couldn't produce much.

@zalkan I've deleted my previous comment as it was very out of line.

This work is stellar and you, and all artists, should be rightfully paid and valued. I hope you forgive my faulty reaction and lack of knowledge on these types of things. Those were definitely questions that shouldn't be directed at the artist. The price is very fair for the amount of skill and quality of this piece, I never intended to argue that.

I think you should be able to sell work and this is in no way copying or stealing. My lack of understanding of legalities was mis-directed. I hope you understand, thank you.
@Mekose Sorry, I've been busy those past month so i didn't took the time to answer you. I thank you for you're reply and reaction, much appreciated, i also deleted my past comment :) Cheers !

Hey, amazing work you did there ! Do you think this can be 3D printed or it's too complex ? And if no, can you (or are you planning to) make a simpler version for 3D printing ? Thanks

Brilliant.
Something about the look on her face looks very natural and life-like. Great great job! :-)
Hi Alena,
Good to see this, well done!
The face works really well, the skin tone is just right.
What I like a little less is how the horns go through the hair, that is very 3D-ish I know hair is tricky and you made stylized hair, that is ok.
Also if you want go go for even more realism, you can bake the shadow on the ground (since this is just a little unique bit)
@Milan Van Damme 
Hi Milan , good to hear from you. Thanks for the feedback!
cool!
Hey, I removed the category Products & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
Beautiful work. I really love the details
I like Expression?Characters float?????????????????
realy good work
can you make it downloadable?
i want to 3d print it
Nice!!!!!!!
Good one...
Very cool.
Hello, am i allowed to use her in my WIP game project please ?
Of course the CC atribution will come back to you
@rtyt sure
Hello, I just wanted to thank you for making the project downloadable and include the textures. The model and textures are amazing and I used them for a personal lighting and look dev practice. 
I leave the link in case you want to see it https://www.therookies.co/projects/7486

Thank you very much and if you have any comments I will be glad to read it :)

Wow Grace, that's just beautiful! I staff picked it :)
Awesome!
I think its apparent we need an entire GoT game in this style now. Great work. 
Animation wise, I'd say watch your spacing and timing, its all a bit even, and some overlap on the spine action and legs would help. Tails a bit stiff, you could add some more follow through. Awesome piece though.
nice character and animation ...Well Done. Love it
Wow. That's so beautiful!!!
These characters are so brilliant! Great job!
Thank You Everybody!  :)
nice..best!
I like what you did with the fingers by putting the edgeloop there for shading.
The characters look pretty cool, nice style. 
The animation could use some work though, not a great reference but it could help: https://33.media.tumblr.com/cd7c8ca83637fe0ba0f02c93a807cb77/tumblr_muxnlhApkO1shrn7zo1_400.gif

@levi23tracewell 
Thanks for your comment?

Although it is possible to adjust the topology to some extent for motion and setup, 
basically it creates it while cleaning up in the course of design and modeling.

So it does not take much time to prepare the topology,
but it is always troubling what kind of topology is good for the model.X(


?Machine translation so it may be funny sentences, I'm sorry...?
can i find someway to download it for study?
null
It would be nice if this ways available to be downloaded but if it's for personal or other commercial use that is fine. I'm wondering now is if there is a story to this character like name and backstory to it. It would be interesting if there is one. Just curious.
The model is great, I don't understand why she has broken feet though.
Wow i I like your model a lot.  I wonder, how do you make that the  outline appears ? 
I rotated the model and always the  outline appears.
did you use only Maya to make this or did you also use Zbrush or some alternative program?
Great model. How did you go about the textures? Creating that constant black contour line like a 2d character?
Simply excellent model, really excellent!

Do you plan to rig or animate it?

I'd be interested in buying it, unless you were planning to share the DL link

(i asked the same about the other model)
Just beautiful.

It's good, but I hate the fact that the hands are infront, so it's so hard to rig.
is too dificult to rigging that model

I'm trying to use this in blender but the cape is purple and the rest is green can someone help

Hey, I added the category Fashion & Style, and I removed the categories Characters & Creatures,  Electronics & Gadgets and  Gaming. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
Great work, did you start modeling from scrap or did you have a 3D scan as a starting point?
Wow! Great Work! I aspire to achieve a similar level of quality someday.
Awesome model, gonna check out that timelapse later!

By the way, is there a way you could provide a T-Posed and rigged model of this? I really would like to bring it to GMod/SFM!
Same with me to SSBB!
I will at some point set this up to work with source to put into SFM. I would like to make some blend shapes for the face and fix up some of the wights
Hey, I'm working on a project with a group of people and we wanted to know if we can use your model (preferably rigged) for this project? We will credit you.
Hey, nice model of Shantae.
If possible, could you send me a model of her please? I am planning on adding her to a Smash Bros. fan project I am working on and was wondering if it would be cool if I could use her as my fighter. Check, I may wanna give her more alternative colors.

Please email me at russellgro@gmail.com, or PM me.

Thanks. I will give credit if interested. :)
infectedfury, this model of Shantae is amazing!  Thank you for sharing it with us. I have a friend who has a 3D Printer and if I ask her nicely she will let me use it.  I really love Shantae and would love to have a real life figurine of her.  I know this is asking a lot, but if you could post this Shantae as an OBJ or a STL file then you would make me so so happy!  Also, just out of curiosity, what program did you use to create her?  She looks like a 3D Cartoon; very nice effect!
Please add this to SFM. It looks so good.
Here, I found this website that auto rigs models to help you out. https://www.mixamo.com
I've been away for a bit, I'll try and get a version of it up sometime soon.

The model is already rigged. here is something that I had done with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K6bbYWitTE
to anyone who wants it. here is a basic joint skinned version of the model
https://www.dropbox.com/s/elol02bwg4umm87/shantae_main.fbx?dl=0

Its scale is set for ue4 so if you want it in sfm/Gmod or smashbros you will have to change it.
Remember to credit me and link back here if you use it.
Thanks for the download, infectedfury. I will give you the credit as possible when I will use her. ;)
I love it! Thanks for sharing your model too, i had a look and it seems the textures are missing, might just be me that are too stupid to figure it out but i figured i'd mention it in case you just forgot to embed them or something, it does seem to link to your Shantae project folder though.
Update to the link.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkur9zpvdk1mptb/Shantae.zip?dl=0
zip file with .tga files
Thanks for the model! I'll be sure to credit you for it when I finish up the Gmod/SFM port.

Just one minor problem though: you forgot the eyebrow textures. Also, does she have morphs too, or is that feature not available at the moment? Thank you.
nice work! is the ink outline an inverted black model or does sketchfab have cell shading filters now?
Just an inverted black model. Would be nice if we could have a cell shading filter.
Is there something else I have to do to get the textures? I'm assuming that I'm just stupid but I can't find them for the life of me
Hey, I love your Shantae Model, Can you make Risky Boots next?
Any chance you could upload this to the steam workshop for Tabletop Simulator? Would be a great game piece
im new to this site so im wondering, how do i see the model in color instead of having it be just a black screen where i can only view the wireframe? again im a newbe so...im sorry if im anoying anybody
@darkdude yes we have a wireframe mode too. Here's the documentation:

Good job bro
Very good use of volumetric lighting and an overall attractive room design. Thanks for the download. It has provided me inspirational direction and creative suggestions to execute and implement into my own 3D ROOM MODELS.
Hello,
Sure, I don't see any problem with that. All I ask from you is to put link to my sketchfab profile somewhere.

Best regards,
Anex
Big inspiration for my first professional demo reel. Thank you!
this obj has no hierarchy..
@ktkim05 I don't think OBJs ever do?
So much atmosphere in such a small room, i like it, goodjob!
Hi

There is no material (.mtl) file along with obj and when I open it in blender it shows no texture.
Thank you.
thanks
thanks for sharing
Wow, at first I thought light was only baked. But nope, it's (also) done with the opacity map and Sketchfab's lights. Great job. Ultra simple geometry but it looks really good at the end.
@hansolocambo 
Thank you :)
We used your model to illustrate dynamic lighting on Sketchfab:

Great work! Can you make a post with a process of your texturing pipeline?
I like to make a handpainted textures, but i've never succeed in anime-style character texturing
I was just wondering what software did you use to make this super cute model

This is excellent, but some transparency of the mandible would greatly help to see action of the lateral pterygoid.

It's soooo fantastic!!
this is soo cool :D

How to download it? it soooo cool ! i want see everyday
Hi @lich007 ! Thank you very much! You can get the alternative version of this model, Rei Ayanami V2 here: 

https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-print-models/art/sculptures/rei-ayanami-sculpt

This version isn't available to download because its very hard (impossible i think) to print the skeleton AND the body at the same time with diferent materials. Sorry!. 
You can check some renders on my artstation :) : https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OlWRJ
Hello @chami.desu But I want the original model in the format of fbx or obj, for Maya. I do not need a statue, she is not so beautiful.
I love it, great work :D
Amazing vision! I just Love this concept
Hiya @chami.desu ! I was wondering if there was ever anything that came of a previous commenter's request to have a .fbx or .obj file created for this model? I would love to rigg and use this model for a 3D usable avatar, just how it is! Transparent with clearly visable skeleture, I fell in love the second I saw it!
Great piece of work, cleverly realized.
null
@Colmhd Thanks a lot, i really appreciate it!

@ArcticaSabre Hi, this is not on sale because it's practically identical to the alternative version, and the skeleton is inside the mesh, so you cant see throught it. Also, the mesh is a mess (lol) because decimation master, so it would be hard to rigg it. Actually i can put it on sale, but i think it's a model useless for print/rigg.
Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

https://sketchfab.com/bartv/collections/followers-milestones
@bartv Yeah, thank you! i'm super happy! I was planning something, i will upload soon :)
Just a trivial comment... the angle between woman's pubes is usually over 90 degrees... so in this case the model should be a man ;)
Wow i I like your model a lot.  I wonder, how do you make that the  outline appears ? 
I rotated the model and always the  outline appears.
Hey @custo ! Thanks for your kind words. Here is a tutorial for the outline thing:

https://blog.sketchfab.com/creating-a-cartoon-outline-for-sketchfab/

In this model, there are two outlines, one for the skeleton and one for the body, but the body is semi-transparent. Also, i had to work with filters to get this result ;)
Perfect for my anatomy studies! You're awesome!!
This is fantastic anatomy/drawing help. Thanks, man. Would love more stuff like this...lots of skeleton/muscle models out there, but it's tough to tell what's going on without any skin, and they're always just standing in T-poses. Really cool seeing the skeleton in motion like this and then having the body on top to see how it actually looks. Thanks for the upload. Really appreciate it!
I-I-I really love it

Quite impressive!
And it's only 6K polys? Very impressive.
well done man! Seems like a like a hollowed out shell from the back side. I am guessing this is how you are able to keep the Polly count so low. Makes for a nice Still.

Thanks everybody, glad you like it :)
Nice. Maybe you could add more subdivision to the sphere? We can see the faces at the border. Or maybe a brighter background will solve the issue.
Hey Steren! 

Thanks for the hint and you're absolutely right about the faces being visible! However it's intended for usage in a game engine and therefore the polygon count has to be as low as possible.
Perfect!
Very nice. Looks great. :)

Ow……X-0


Thank you for pointing out !
( Please tell me if there is a good name …)
@yanagi*2

You may try something like this list:
http://masterrussian.com/aa031001b.shtml
As a native speaker I may confirm that this list is more or less competent :)

In fact, there are not much originally russian names in use now. Most of them are actually of non-slavic origin; for example, aforementioned Misha (full form would be Mikhail) is procured from hebrew (who is like god). 
Also a large amount of greek-based names used. This comes from religious conversion from original paganic religion to orthodox (greek) christianity.

Female names of definitely slavic origins would be Vera (means Faith), Nadezhda (Hope), Lubov (Love), Lada (Beloved), Iskra (Spark), Lyudmila (Dear to people), Rada (Hapiness), Svetlana (Light).

How did you make the textures look so nice and bright?
WOW this is so awesome :D looks like a nice videogame!
@tenchiken 
Thank you for your polite description!
It became very study.
It will be a reference for the future of naming.
@_demonix_ 
?????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????

Thank you look up to fine place!
But time might take, we are making preparations to be able to unveil the future.
@kashu 
Thanks for leaving comment!

I think that some means certain.
Also to adjust the following points as well as texture.

-Bloom
-Tone mapping
-Color balance

Only the adjustment of the Light and the Environment,
Since the result in Too bright or Too Dark,
It has a combination of post-processing filter.
(Probably, Tone Mapping easy way to solve this.)

However, it will have changed depending on the color and the situation with the character.
So, I'm sorry for not clearly can advice.
(It may have a good example ... X-(

This is so incredibly inspiring! I love how well this has been executed in both modelling and illustrative style.
How do you manage to create the textures? Did you draw it on a UV map, im new to texturing.
Love your work!
very lovely work. Love the facial expression too!
Such amazing work!
@tastymajestic Thank you!! It's all done through a color map, yes! I did the textures in 3D-coat so I could paint straight on the mesh & pretty much just textured as if I was only doing the linework of an illustration
Outstanding work, I love the pose, color scheme and subtle DoF. Staff pick!

Beatiful and elegant !
That is some really REALLY good faux 2D!
This is magnificent!
Amazing! Beautiful! How do you get an outline?
I absolutely adore the Style. Really great!
I even overlook the lack of the classic Tiefling Tail.
Amazing and inspiring!
Oh gosh this is what I want to be able to achieve some day with my models. Amazing work. I love it so much.
This is gorgeous! I'd love to see the progression of translating that look into 3D. Keep making awesome stuff! :)

Supercool! Nice details. They don't make cars like this anymore... :)
Is this just a suggestion from you to the game developers or this in fact one of the vehicles coming to the game?
You sir has just made one more follower ! GREAT WORK!
It's an actual model appearing in Dying Light. :)

Glad you like it!
Sweet! Really nice details! I got amazed of hos much details there were in the current vehicles in the game! but this looks even more realistic and amazing, and it's drivable ! can't wait to test it out! :D
Any idea when it's going to be available? :)
Sadly it's not driveable in game. Although there are some interactions with it. ;)
Okey, I tought it was a car for the upcoming update with the new map ;) 
Do you have any driveable vehicles done to show ?

How much time did you put into this car ? :)
I'm afraid I can't tell more than what you can find in trailers. ;) The car took about one full week (5 work days).
okey, I understand ;) 
I'm going to do my first attempt to create a car very soon, do you have any good suggestions on a car to a newbie ? :)
Look up blueprints, refs, photos, dimensions, keep surfaces perfect... and mind that first one wont be good. ;)
which program do you use for modeling and rendering? :)

Enjoy :-)
@bartv 

Awesome :D

Also, I will take a look, why not. ;)
loved the wet effect in the glass..
Just unbelievable work! Could you pls tell, what size are texutres and how many materials? Thank You!
I specifically remember stopping to oogle over the vehicle props in DL, It's not often you see low/midpoly cars with a lot of care put into them.

The Fiat Punto was what convinced me to join this site, I had no idea you made these vehicles too. Thanks for putting your work here to inspect up close!
@rush_freak I'm so glad you liked them! It really means a lot. :) You're welcome... and expect more! You can check out other Dying Light models on Sketchfab as well, those 4 wheeled are usually mine too. ;)
very well done men it looks really bad ass and is very detailed

May i ask how did you make the transparency on the veil? was it an alpha channel?
Wow she looks so amazing! :)
I hope you don't me asking, but what program did you use to texture her in?
Hey, just wanted to let you know that this was featured on our social media! Congrats!
obj pls
@dark_angel558 Sorry, I can't give out the model file ^^;
I would get the 3d printer output again thanks
@dark_angel558 Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean but the model is property of Riot Games and I don't have permission to give out their files.
did you recreate her or did you extract her straight from the game, I know some people do that and either way it's really cool
@deadlyvenomousskateboarding Thanks, I designed and created the 3D model that's in the game & all of the models in my gallery. I would never post someone else's work.
nice boobs
@furkan294 She definitely has some! :D
You can use Riot's IP to make fan created art, but you cannot make a personal profit from it.

All information of legal use can be found at this link:

https://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber

That said, please make this downloadable.
@adrunkenpyrate Yea, the profit thing goes for all fan art :P

This model I made while working at Riot is posted here as part of my portfolio. Talk to Riot for permission, thanks!
@maddytaylor  Ah... That's my mistake then, and I apologize for assuming differently!

It's great work, by the way! This is by far one of my favorite Miss Fortune Skins along with Star Guardian!

Awesome!!
This is great, such a fantastic idea!
This is really awesome! I am really interested in your modelling process for this!
@ HaWkZ Got me a simple map over google and made it black and white with a slight blur. Applied it to a high res geosphere in 3Ds Max, used the displace modifier to get the landmasses of the texture. Opened it in Zbrush and heavily sculpted it.

@Alban
France got squashed by the Alps, sorry. But Germany, where I live, too. :)
Nice!
Good idea and conception, my critic would be about the water texture, which I find a bit too generic, maybe we could have some swirls of foam, to match the general cartoon style.

(my favorite part in your work is the pole icebergs, the modeling and texture are really cute, I just could eat it ! :P)
It can be now downloaded for 3D printing here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:671647
And also over at Shapeways for letting it print in color: https://www.shapeways.com/product/LFWU8VM6X/the-whole-world?li=shop-results&optionId=55511618

PS @TocoGamescom: you do know you can make the file downloadable here too, right? Just sayin' ;-)
@ Bart
Cool!
I would like to make the three .stl versions for printing here also downloadable but it seems I can only choose to let the files, that are also in viewer visible, downloadable. Or I'm missing something?
@TocoGamescom take a look at this:

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/quick-tip-adding-supporting-files-to-your-zip-upload/73

From what I've understood, you could put the STL files in a subdirectory of the .zip file that you upload. Only the 3D files at the root of your upload will be used for visualization. Give it a try, and let me know how if it works? (Leave a note on the forum, then everyone else can use it too)
Wonderful!

Thanks Kristijonasbakas, we have a few more poses of her to process, we may also have her come back for a full scan session (this was just a test).
will this model be made available for download or purchase at some point?
@joebloggspunter there are no plans for making this model available, at the moment. But when she visits our studio next time, I will talk to her about it. Thank you for your interest!
I would love to print her as a statue, in glass!  Let me know if interested.

wow very nice work and excellent modeling.
Looks like an SSX character. Great model!
Extremely cute!  & I agree w/ b14.. my partner & I were just playing SSX the other day at the studio :-D
Oh she also has teeth!
Wow! This is incredible. Thanks for sharing :)
Great model! Now if we could only 3d print people right? :)
Haha, I couldn't agree more :) 

And yes. She has teeth! I got them from the free mesh collection at Flippednormals.com you should check out the site, it's really great!
I keep coming back to look at this model every day to remind myself what I need to get my models to look like! Don't stop sharing!
Great! So much detail!
Thank you for all your lovely comments! :-) they make me want to do more so I can share it with you.
Very positive composition, nice colors :]
But I think a little bit many small details around head ^o^
Great work!  Excellent character! Luv the concept, colors, shoes, everything!
So pretty and full of details!
Hi, nice model. But I see couple problems with smoothing groups and textures. This is w.i.p. ?
Cheers!
What a nice piece of work, the colors, the topology, incredible.
Lovely character! what gorgeous colours you've chosen
loving the writing on the walkman ;)
Awesome. Liked, especially for the Stitch button. ;)
Beautiful model! Love the variety of colors :)
Love the decriptions on the walkman n stuff :)

Thank you so much!
Great work!
wow i love it
what file type did youy upload it as
I uploaded an .obj file and its .mtl file to make sure all the materials are separated.
I love what you've done, it looks so nice and clean and even his posing feels like it was done by the overwatch team themselves. My only crit is that you modeled almost all of the detail, including very small things that could easily be textured instead
Stopping by to let you know that this is on Polycount's Sketchfab Spotlight! Congrats! 

http://polycount.com/discussion/178637/sketchfab-spotlight-october-2016
im looking to try to make a custom bastion pc case, is your model available for download at all? the fact that you modeled in a lot of stuff instead of texturing it makes it even better for 3d printing.
This may come out strange but whats the background? It looks so nice :D
great job now make it transform
That's amazing! Good Job!
Amazing! Just one questions: How do you download it?
@blah768522  you don't
does anyone have the payloads of Overwatch?
Really hope I can 3d print this model as personal collection, I'm a big fan of Overwatch. Is that possible for you to share the model files?
What type of software do you use to make them and you have the scale or blueprints for bastion?
No downloads? Darn.
Looks great dude how can I download this model?
VAI TOMA NO CU FILH DA PUTAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 OK OK BROW XITADO
Hi, where is the download?
null
@gabrieljgarcia Hi, I cant find the uploaded files for the .obj and .mtl files... can you please re-upload the files? :/
@gamerboy100player The artist probably doesn't want anyone to save it so he removed the option to do so. But if you really want it, it might help to ask him directly and see if you can come up with a price to convince him to give you the files.

You check check this out - https://www.blendernation.com/2015/11/16/instant-meshes-a-free-qaud-based-autoretopology-program/
I just found instant meshes and it works like magic. Easy decimation and instant quad-based topology. You can try this for such projects since it is free and the results are great.
Awesome work!

I noticed the link back to @uviclib is broken in the description though - there is an extra . at the end :)
@nebulousflynn Thank you for the nice comment Thomas, and nice catch for the broken link! It is fixed!
@bojidarkn Thanks for the suggestion! I actually have used Instant meshes before and was about to tell you that although it is indeed a great piece of software (and based on some nice science too!), it required manual processing (and I am trying to automate many steps of my workflow).
But I just discovered - thanks to you ;) - that i can also be used in command line from a terminal, which is of the uttermost interest to me (geek/programmer inside). I will definitely look into that approach!
wow!!!!! thank you very much!
Man!

 
these skulls shake me to the bone!

this is very cool! I would love to see your process!
@miekeroth You are very welcome :) Let me know if you make something fun out of them!
@SuperOni But do they send shivers down your spine ( https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ ) ? :D

 I'll maybe showcase the process in a future upload (don't take my word for granted though...), but the basic steps are quite simple.

1. Download every interesting model, and keep the credits somewhere safe (manually of course)
2. Unzip every archive and other archives inside (python)
3. Ask the diffuse/normal map correspondance for every model (interactive python)
4. Once this is done, and for every model, launch a blender/python script:
  4.1 - Import the scan depending on its extension
  4.2 - Clean it up and scale it to a unit box
  4.3 - Import the textures and plug them in a principled shader
  4.4 - Remesh the object ( I use mmgs www.mmgtools.org + an iterative script of collapse decimation / planar decimation / shrinkwrap in blender, but would like to prospect with meshlabserver and instantmeshes in command line )
  4.5 - Unwrap the remeshed object
  4.6 - Bake the textures and normals from the scan to the remeshed object
  4.7 - Save the model, rename everything and export the textures
5 - Import every model in a new blender file and export and zip to fbx + textures (still python)

I am still working on the workflow/scripting though (and sadly, keeping it to myself for the time being), but I hope that you now have more clues, and have fun with the models!
Will do!
@norgeotloic thank you for talking about it, I thought the process was going tibia hard to  understand, but it seem very clear.
@SuperOni Dude, you're good ! I wanted to make a skeleton pun myself, but I did not have the guts ;)
that really nice thank you man
@UnVerreDeLait My pleasure :)
Sweet. Awesome work here.
@smallpoly Thanks :)
Thank you for sharing a lot of assets.

Can I use it for commercial game production?
It is under a CC-attribution license, which means that yes, you can. Just don't forget to put an attribution somewhere (as easy as a link to the model in a .txt file)!
And if you are a super-nice someone (I mean, you asked, so you must be!), I'd be really happy if you could send me a link or a screenshot of your project to see where those assets ended up :)
Cheers!
Hi there!  Thanks for making these models available.  They are awesome!  I've shared these on thingiverse in 3d print format so I'm expecting some great makes!  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3186816
@dtm247 You are welcome :) Do not hesitate to leave a comment if you manage to find pictures of prints done from these models, I'd love to see them :)
@norgeotloic I still have some cleaning up to do and plan to paint with same style in your render but here is the first print....

https://www.thingiverse.com/make:560821
Beautiful
@dtm247 Awesome work! 
Let me know if you manage to do something cool with the painting, I'd be happy to have a look !
And thanks for the 'extensive' citation too :)
@Gil.Ferreira Glad you appreciate it! 
Do not hesitate - if you did not already - to visit @uviclib profile, from whom all the scans come.
Great work!

aeeeeeeeeeeeeee)!!!! TNX)!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey, I removed the categories Architecture,  Electronics & Gadgets and  Science & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
I just did a 3D print of this model, which was fun!  It would be nicer if the model hadn't omitted the very top of the head.

Love this one, staff pick.
@alban @bartv  hey , Whenever I re-upload the fbx, the lighting setup and the camera resets and I also have to apply all the materials(maps) again, why is that? It wasnt use to be like this before? or am I missing something here ?
@umer.memon it used to be liked that, then @mrchlblng added the awesome save-settings-on-reupload feature, but it recently broke :) Known bug, should be fixed this week hopefully
@alban cool, I need that cuz I re-upload alot :D
I am in love :D
Great work! Truly inspiring, thank you for sharing.
Awesome!
good for > rpg XD
@umer.memon the reupload is back to normal and will keep camera/postprocess/annotations/materials wherever it makes sense (had sadly been broken for ~10 days)! Hope to see more iterations of your models :)
@mrchlblng  Oh great ! just in time :D
Great work!
Very impressive! Keep up the great work :)
We recommended your work for this week's Sketchfab roundup on IAMAG:

@bartv  Cool , Thanks :D
This is really something!  Good work!
Magnificent scene! Any chance having this in Unreal Engine 4? :-)
@onebonsai hey thanks :) , Not branching out to UE Marketplace as yet. the castle only uses a diffuse map, so If you import it into UE4 it'll look the same ;)
Hey small question, what is the map size ? 1024*1024?
@alpha-fr The castle walls and roofs have been atlased in a 2k map, and the foliage and rocks have a separate 1k maps

Awesome model thanks for making it. Currently in the proces of bronze casting this design. Made a 200% print and now i'm waiting on the cast to be finished. Hope it turns out as beautifull as the 3d print
@RotjongNL I've seen a few prints that people have done and they've turned out pretty well. On smaller casts, the corner of the mouths tend to fall apart a little bit due to a cavity inside of the mouth. Definitely let me know how it turns out!
@justingulenchyn 


Hi there. Well the casting is finished and i must say i love how it turned out. Minor differences between the 3d print and the final cast. It only adds to the charm of it i feel. Also done with sanding and polishing. Too clean a look wouldn't fit the lore i think. I would like to add a pic here but i wouldn't know how to...... :(
http://imgur.com/wgHSm88

There fixed it
@RotjongNL Yeah dude that looks sick. The material is perfect!
@justingulenchyn 

Yea its difficult to capture it on camera though. Irl it's very clearly a golden/yellow hue but i've taken some photos where it looks like silver. Added some more pics on imgur if people are interested. 

Again thanks loads for creating this model. Up next divine orb?

are those particles?
@essimoon :) thanks! It is actually not really difficult to make that fire, I could make a tutorial about when I find time for.
@belich No particles just some animated spheres with fire textures and a lot of bloom post processing.
That's pretty cool, even if the thing itself is a bit odd. I see you used bloom for this effect. But I'm finding myself that a scene has to be arbitrarily dark most of the time to really make good use of it for glowing emitter materials. (No channel separation in post unlike the Blender compositor, so it's not a very selective effect and will effect reflections too.) But now that I know how you did it, that still gives me an idea. :)
@pauljs75 Thanks :).
Yes the scene needs to be very dark to get this effect work,so dark I hade to give emission = 1 to the arme chair material.
Here is a overview about the background and the material settings in Sketchfab.

Hey, I added the category Art & Abstract, and I removed the categories Architecture,  Electronics & Gadgets and  Places & Travel. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
@nebulousflynn Thank you and it’s nice to see that there are more category’s now, awesome!
Could you correct my other 615 models for me? Just kidding, I'll do it when I find time :)
This is pretty cool.. what a hell of a chair!!! LMAO :) ;)

As the animation effects are so subtle, it's a good call to put this in the 'static' category.
It was not planned to be in the animated category. But since there is a bit of animations, I had to switch it to the animation category.
@bartv C0re just told me on the forum I would consider this animated ..

So what am i supposed to do ? ^^'

because  it was intended to be a static scene at first.
I'd definitely use still. Sorry Seori :)
Well you know what? I'm having second thoughts about this. Maybe it IS better to put this in the animated category after all - it'll be more clear to everyone what's still and what's animated that way. Sorry about the confusion!
Okey I understand :)

thanks for the response =)
well....what to say....I love it! Seriously, compliments!!
@sensationalgames Thanks. :)
Love this!!! What program(s) did you use and how did you illuminate the candles? Brilliant work!
@rd2studio Thanks :)

I used 3DSmax and Zbrush (the gargoyles) for the modelisation and Substance painter for the textures.
And i used emissive maps for illumination of the candles
Congratulations for the beautiful and immersive work!
congrats, had actually shared this already with my friends :)
Congratulations JER3D! You won third place in the Animated category in our Lights, Camera, Immersion Contest!

https://blog.sketchfab.com/lights-camera-immersion-contest-winners/

I got in touch for your prizes!
Excellent work.  One of the best I have seen so far.
Congrats! You deserved it xD
Thanks :D
This looks great in the Vive, really pulls you into the environment.  the HD is a little rough though frame rate wise, SD works fine.

how long did that take
@OhDawgDeBarge  what do you mean this is perfect in every direction just it does not have the bewitched ceiling effect
Looks awesome! I do have a question. Could I possibly import this into VRChat? I will be sure to credit you of course for your work.
@RogerDelmar Contact me via email if you are intersted by the model :)
could you make this downloadable? I really wanna import it into unreal and walk around in it in vr :P

Woah !! Brillant scan ! How many pictures ?
@lpmn Thanks! 352 photos in total.
Stunning model!
I tried to download it to put it into an Unreal Engine project, it seemed like materials were not included in the file though? It has a white material applied in Blender (and subsequently in UE)
@paladin

Thanks!

I have no experience with downloading models here or how they're packed. What I can tell you is that the material was applied using nodes in the Cycles renderer. I know that materials/maps are handled differently between the Blender native renderer and Cycles. Hope this info helps troubleshoot the problem.
It`s a wonderful 3d model, but i have problems with this file in blender. Can you upload this file in 3DS-Format or FBX-Format ( with texture ) ? I will be very glad if you can do this for me. Thank you very much.
Hey, just wanted to let you know that this was featured on our social media! Congrats!
wonderful 3d model !
this has always been a favorite of mine, you did well on it
Very nice.
Thanks everybody!
Hi, Misterdevious!  
I'm a game developer and I'm currently working on a horror game. I really love your scans and I'm interested on how much would those scans cost if it would be to use them in our game! Here's a trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai_4JDYxEsw
Hi @darkaniaworks 

Send a note to munkitrash [at] gmail.com and let me know which ones you may be interested in.

Thanks!
awesome
Hey, I removed the categories Characters,  Products & Technology and  Science, Nature & Education. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
The model is done very well. Thank you.
this models are free to use or need license from you?
I love this statue, and the model is beautiful.
Wonderful work

Hello there. How much aprox do you charge for modeling one character like this?
@UnChild 

Hi UnChild, I just sent you an email.

Thank you! :)
Hi,
I wanted to say congrats 'cause the model is awesome!
I was also wondering if the fbx file of her can be animated in maya. Do you know if there are problems with that? 
thanks in advance
Matteo
@Matteo.Bagnoli 

Hi Matteo, thank you!

I haven't tested it in Maya, but I believe you shouldn't have a problem considering it's a simple rig.

I have tested other models using similar rigs and configurations in various softwares and they all worked flawlessly.

I'll see if I can download a trial version of Maya and do some tests to make sure, though. I'll let you know here when I do.

Thank you!
@Matteo.Bagnoli 

Hi Matteo, I managed to do some tests in Maya and the rig works just fine :)
Great model. Imported into Maya via supplied FBX file, works well. Obviously if you want to animate in Maya you'll have to redo the IK handles which goes for any FBX export/import – shame, because author's IK work in Blender is really nice. Topology is nice and clean too, using it as a base for low poly and easily got the count down 10-15x without sacrificing quality. Money well spent.
@myk31 

Hi Mykola, thank you for the great review! I really appreciate it! :D

And I agree, it's really a bummer that more complex rigs configurations are not interchangeable. That would be really great. ^^

The current rig is a basic one, but it's the only way I found to cover most software without having lot's of different files that may not be future proof, it's also one that will work with most game engines and mocap data, so it's a give or take situation.

Hopefully in the future this can be addressed, a single format to rule them all would be awesome, hehe :)
hello, I don't see any email? >>> How much aprox do you charge for modeling one character like this?
@UnChild 

Hi UnChild,

It was sent to the same email I received you message from Sketchfab from (hely@......). 
I just sent it again. If you want me to send to another email adress, please send me a personal message. ^^

About the pricing, it really depends on what you'll need and how long it will take, so I'd need to know a bit more about what you have in mind :)
@murilo.kleine Hey! I need 2 Individual Models with each 1 simple animation =) Its for a Website (Register Page)

For the gender Selection... I Need a Anime Char in Male and one in Female. If Char get selected i need to trigger the animation event.

What you think this will cost? You dont need to model the whole character. maybe only the head and a part of the torso.
@bamigorengo 

Hi bamigorengo, thanks for reaching out!

Do you think you could send me a private message on ArtStation? http://artstation.com/artist/murilokleine 

That way I can learn more about what your project needs and give you a better estimation on prices and time :)

Thank you!
Most excellent work for such a low price. Thanks for providing this kind of quality assets to the community. Great !

what kind of hdri map did you use to get this shadow ?
@newford123 

Hi newford, you can download a similar one on this tutorial model I made: https://skfb.ly/6HwVQ

It's free! ^^
Hi, Have you ever tried this on Unity?
@pjc0247 

Hi pjc, sorry for not answering before. 

I've tested similar models and they worked fine, specially for custom animations. 

If you want to use third party animations you may need to adjust the rig setup in Unity though. Same for Unreal.
Great model mr Kleine (or Murilo? IDK :D) it's a pity there isn't a male version as low-poly (or better with less polygons) as this... the standard license permits editing the mesh (changing the textures, modifying the hair and the clothes, etc...) ? (I haven't an artstation account to contact you, I'm embarrassed to get an account, not being a 3d artist, just a 3d hobbyist, myself :') please add other methods to contact you!! ) TIA
@C1CC1010 Hi there, no problem! Yes, you can change anything to your liking and use the model anywhere you want. Once you buy the model, Sketchfab provides direct contact with me :)

@james thank you!
Looks good but when I try to import the obj file in to 3ds max the textures are missing and its a single object.
@user619 I don't have 3Ds MAX so everything the follows is a guess: I first tried uploading .png textures, but this failed. I uploaded the .jpg textures which you downloaded. However, the .mtl file still refers to the .png textures. You could either:

- edit the .mtl file with the correct texture file endings (.jpg). Textures should then be in the same folder when importing the .obj file
- Assign the texture files directly in 3Ds MAX

I will try to reupload the updated .mtl file once I find out if that can be done without breaking the whole model.

You inspire me to design and baking interiors. Thank you for the fantastic fotogrammetry.
@ykdesign I am very happy to hear, thank you!
How can I add my rendered 3d visualization in this way?
@baklananton Hi Anton, not entirely sure what you mean. The textures and meshes are created based on photos processed by photogrammetry software.
@fhernand Hi) yes, I understand that this is photoscanned model, but I'm interested in the way you can pull the render on the model. I tried baking lights (unwrap and render to texture) in 3ds max, but it does not display correctly on Sketchfab
Awesome model! Recently found it in mobile AR app : https://youtu.be/W3grKAcGyUo?t=24 , looks really great!
@tratata001 thanks, gonna check it out there :)
Hi, great job! Can you tell me more about how the process was done (while taking the photos)? The position of the tripod, angles, etc. Thanks!
@mamafeet this example from @nebulousflynn pretty much describes my process: https://sketchfab.com/models/e8e68b7adeeb4014a1914947fa4c8e1b
In addition I also took pictures around certain objects, just making sure to cover as much as possible. Aperture was at f11 to get a good balance of depth of field, exposure time and sharpness. I used a wide angled lens (11mm) to reduce the number of required images.
thanks a lot
Thank you for allowing us to down load your work.

@AlfiArts thanks! if youre referring to the water caustics, i handpainted them! i was going to do a panning texture in unreal but i decided to just handpaint for now lol and if youre referring to the splashing, i just achieved that with planes haha
This is so beutiful! <3 What program did you use to create this?
@PositivePatience thank you so much!! I used Maya to model and photoshop as well as substance painter to texture! most of the texturing/polish is done in photoshop!
@jacinta Wow! Thanks so much :D I'm starting my first animation class next semster so your work has been really helpful in inspiring me and getting excited for the course! I know they'll be using Maya but I shall look into Substance painter!
@PositivePatience i'm excited for you! youre going to make super great things and thank you thank you so much for your kind words!!! substance painter is a texturing program where you can paint directly onto the model! a lot of people use 3DCoat too as well as just texturing in blender!

Maybe we should add a new effect like fade in without camera animation for models with 'environment'. I mean user could select the one he prefers
btw nice scene :)
Thank you trigrou and Maurice S!
I think it's fun to have that weird camera movement in a way, but yes it would be good to have the choice.
Wow, stunning work. Love your attention to detail, even the rocky ground plane :)
I'm really impressed by the result for such a web-optimized model! So is vray baking an easy process? We should look into a vray exporter than :)
Thanks for the staffpick!
I baked the lighting/shading to textures in Vray for Maya, and it's very easy actually. I also used the Maya exporter available here which worked great, just had to change a few settings for the maps and voila!
I just wish there was a way to have a shadeless render + specularity.
mind-blowing presentation :) WOW!
Awesome work and design, as always...   ;)
Truly outstanding.
so clever DOF faking! well done!

this is so inspiring!

I think Blizzard would love the idea of a Demon Hunter Murloc. Did you win?
i think this Murloc is a worthy successor )
Very cool!
That Murloc is true Badass!
Very cool and good composition, layers and LOD! I liked 'walking' through this one.
Thanks for the kind comments everyone. :)

Great model, thank you! Although I'm having a small issue, I'm using Ultimaker Cura to slice the model, but the wings and the lower layer of the model have errors, Cura highlighted them as Red and won't print them. Any idea on how to fix this?
Do not let download. can you help me?
@profzedhp Try autodesk netfab premium they have a auto repair tool i fixed many models with it :D
in what program can I open the file

But thete are a few things wrong with it. 

*Aimpoint RPS is black, not grey. 

*The pistol grip is hollow, not solid, usually has the owners name written in it

*Front iron sight should be flipped down when using red dot sights. 

*In the very front of the rail, below the right side of it, the ridge or peg should be black not green.

*Personal preference: the front grip should not be mounted in the back of the rail mount, but instead in the middle, unless the soldier has very short arms.

...thank you very much for the compliment @Ricardo Nunes !!! also you did a great job with your Tiger I.
Now let's wait for the results :-) !
Very curious to see what will be more valued: model detail, overall scene composition, relation to WOT gameplay, Sketchfab usage, etc.
Hi Rober,

thanks for joining the World of Tanks Diorama contest! Together with the Wargaming team we'll be picking the winners on Wednesday. Until then, you should try to get as many views and likes on your model as you can - they are included in the judging process. Consider posting your model on Facebook or Twitter, and sharing it with your own World of Tanks communities, or on other game design communities.

The final selection will be announced on Thursday. Good luck!!
Thanks @Bart...I hope to be lucky!!!
Nice model Rober! Excellent level of details!
Rober, you've won 3rd place in the World of Tanks contest, congratulations!! We'll get you your prizes as soon as possible.

http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/120687831934/the-world-of-tanks-contest-winners-are-in
@Bart Thank you so much ... I did not expect at all, it more...I was disappointed for not having been able to spend more time with my diorama. I every so often, enter at the forum to see how other competitors were coming in the contest and saw many works of very good level. I never tire of saying: Thank you !!! I'll try to take the most benefit of these three months of Sketchfab Pro (also the prize of Jinx's are great ... but as I'm in Argentina is very unlikely that it can use it.)

This looks really great. Do you use a 3D scanner for this? would love to know more about your work flow and the creation process.
Thanks @tux and @saypedro! I made this model using a turntable.

Thanks, @magadan! I need to scan it again - it looks like a very different garden now. :-)

Amazing model! It looks like a new gen of anatomy 3D. Is it done based on a surface scanner on a dissected body? If not, how did you manage this natural feeling within the morphology materials and textures?
@Melodicpinpon  Thanks for your comments. This was modeled using photography references and medical illustrations. No scanned was used all medical artistry.

That is great! I study anatomy in high school and this model really helps me to understand the structure of the human body better. Since I don't want to waste time on boring subjects, I hire assignment-help-au.com to work on some tasks for me. It is better to spend time working on useful and fascinating projects.
It is a great rendering. I will ask my students to look at this.
Only thing is when you click it zooms in a little bit too much. And it would be great if there is an option to get rid of the veins.

Awesome!!!
Great visualization method! Have you described your workflow somewhere?
@felipeguadagnin @redy Thank you guys! 

@jerbot You're damn right: the Tonga and Kermadec subduction system is the most active on (and under earth), as plates converge at a rate of 24cm/year - which is huge. The crust therefore dives faster and stays rigid longer, which explains the deeper earthquakes compared to other zones... 

@chaspo Thanks! If you are curious, I described a similar workflow for another type of data here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/24h-of-crime-in-la-72261ed877b648269b72da96cd7e167f#comments

Let me know if you're interested, and I'll add a link to the Python script I wrote for this visualization!
@norgeotloic If you're offering, I'd be curious to take a look at the code. My python needs some refreshing...  but slowly getting back into it. Your code could be helpful on the road.  BTW, have you seen this point cloud visualizer Blender Addon?  https://blenderartists.org/t/point-cloud-visualizer/684180/96
@jerbot I've updated the model description with the script I used ( plus some comments ;) ). It should be quite easy to re-use, or at least understand !
Thanks for the point cloud addon, I already stumbled upon it but never used it yet... Will make sure to have a look !
Thanks for sharing Loic!!!!
@norgeotloic Thanks.  I've grabbed the python, and this 3D scene.  This lines up with a lot of my work...  and some areas I want to explore more. Should be fun!
Super cool and beautiful, staffpick
@alban Thank you for that one Alban :D
Interesting
Hello, great work. A color bar would be very helpful (to understand the in between values better). Having it on the description is fine as well. Cheers.
null
Amazing ! I love your ideas and it feels so good just to get lost in those points :D
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww amazing!!!!
Amazing!!!!!! I wondered How you Texture It (Cuz Im not good At texturing XD)
@jerbot I'll wait for your next experiments then ;) !

@tupinambamiguel @Petro.Stepaniuk @Madeele @santiagoramet Thanks for your feedback lads :D !

@Mysticreator Actually I did not texture the model (not in the way of using an image for the colors), but assigned colors to the different earthquakes according to their magnitude. The way to do so was using home-made programming, in order to recreate a custom-made .ply point cloud file. You can find more info on the .ply file format in a nice documentation done by @pbourke (thanks Paul!) here: http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/

@theovasilis Thanks Theo ! I would indeed like to find an elegant way to incorporate colorbars or legends in the point cloud visualizations, that could really help the data comprehension. I did not work on colorbars yet, but a previous attempt that worked well for the legends is available on this model if you are curious (converting colored textures into points): https://skfb.ly/6GVSS

Hi. Nice model. Is it available to download or purchase?
@gkt1965 It is not for sale and can only be used non-commercial.
hi was looking for a jurassic world gyrosphere 3d model and yours is the best great job. im interested in using your model for something i want to make for my car it would be a one off. in your previous comment you said its not for sale and can only be used non commercial so since my application is non commercial are you alowing  downloads for non commercial use
This is awesome! Nice work! I'm doing a personal, non-commercial animation test with an Indominus Rex rig.  I'd love to use your Gyrosphere in my shot.  Let me know how I can get the files from you.  Thanks!
Downloaded
@QinChen..Shun how did you download it
Great work, I love this model. 
Since there is no download button, Would i be able to get a copy of this, for a personal project i am doing?

Beautiful model.
What is your process doing this kind of asset. I mean, do you sketch first the textures and modelise on it ? Modelise and texturing ? or maybe both technics ?

Thank you! It may be ugly and some may even be offended but, its science and important to understand!
freaking models!
Great model!, Could you make it downloadable or sell?

If the little one had yet a smaller version of her resting on her hand, I would have freaked out.
@nataliak Thanks so much, hope you like it.
@nazhebidmao thanks too!

@JoseDiaz Curiosamente hubiera sido un grandioso detalle hacer algo repetitivo jaja, así como un bucle
Jaja, me olvide de mencionar, excelente trabajo!
@JoseDiaz Muchas Gracias de antemano jaja, no te preocupes por ello, yo te agradezco a ti por tu comentario.
Quick tip: double-click on the miniature model to make her the camera pivot point. It'll be much easier to navigate :)
@bartv thats a good idea!!
It is done, the miniature model its the pivot point
Thanks so much!
Great, thanks! We also recommended your work for this month's Sketchfab roundup on 3D-Station:

I appreciate the detail of your publication *_*
Welcome!

Great 3D model.
Wow this looks so amazing and cool. I love the textures! :)
How did you get the shading in the hair so smooth?

Awesome. I love how she hold a miniature of herself xD
Amazing work.

Really impressive work.
Hey, I added the category Art & Abstract, and I removed the category Characters & Creatures.

This is part of our category refresh, you can read about the update here:                            

https://blog.sketchfab.com/introducing-our-new-categories/                            

And view guidelines for each category here:                            

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines                            

Soon we will limit each Sketchfab scenes to two categories, so choose carefully!                            You can use tags to further classify your model.
Wow, very cool!
Great!
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

surrrrreal!, I Love  this!. I like  the zed brush but I have A little nerve trouble & just can't seem to get me to do what it wants me to do, so even A straight line is A bit of A hurtal. but there's nothing to keep me from trying is there?. And thank you for sharing your magic!!.
thank you very much guys :)

@Xenobe:
thank you :)
there is a feature inside of zbrush and it´s called lazy mouse. just select any brush and 
press the L key for turning on or off. another tool is out there:
please google for: lazy nezumi pro. maybe you want to check it out in combination with zbrush or
another app ? lazy nezumi pro you can also use with photoshop etc.

even the shakiest hand can draw clean strokes with the help of that easily ;)

Ollie
Thank you for both your insight and pointers, I will certainly take advantage of them.
Love this look and style. Love to chat about some of your designs for a game I’m developing
null
Really awesome!! The skull and the face fit together perfectly, congratulations!!
@D3Moon thank you :) it was a happy accident during 
the sculpting session  in Zbrush.
sometimes that happens which is a good thing ;)
Really cool!!
@tthuddleston 

thank you very much.
Hello impressive work! Can you help me? how you create this metallic glossy effect on render? 
thanks alot
@p0z1tron 

hi p0z1tron,

thank you very much. i mainly use zbrush for my sculpting / 3d modeling work.
then i reduce the original model due to polycount reasons. and then i create
normal and ambient occlusion maps with xnormal. you can find this on google.

then i go to 3dcoat and do all the texturing there. there is a free trial version out there
which you can try. with lots of presets called smart materials. i tweak them to my needs, create & export
my maps that i need for sketchfab: normal map, ambient occlucsion, metallness, glossines etc. 
and that´s basically it. you can also give the software substance painter a try. my computer is 
too outdated so i use 3dcoat but these tools do basicaly all the same.

give it a try - i looked at your models - you create great work - just transfer them to realtime.

cu - and if you have a question don´t hesitate to ask.

greetings and kind regards,

ollie / cosmic
Gorgeous AF. I randomly found this site for 3d model skull references, but I'm discovering this is a vastly more magical place
HOLLY FLOP. THIS HAS NO TRYS!
@samueleunimancer what does that mean exactly? I new here.
no tryangles. only correct topology!

great models! the texturing on everything is fantastic, cant fault one thing... and its great seeing some fellow aussies kicking ass on sketchfab!
I noticed you didn't add any category or tags to your model. It's an important thing to do so it'll show up in the right galleries, getting you more exposure! Please consider updating it :)
How much time did it take?... assuming you made it all at once. 
It's a shame we can't set 3D wallpapers
We suggested your work to It's Art Magazine for their weekly picks and they included it! Enjoy :)

Thank you all! :D Very motivating feedback!
@rocketman1331 it took roughly 5 eight hour days.
@bartv @nataliak @signe That's AWESOME! Thank you so much! Very honored. :) 
@bartv I updated the tags etc.

Incredible! Lots to explore here  - giving it my Staff Pick :)
\o/ Wuhu! :)
Great scene ! And like @nataliak said, there is so much to explore.

Just a suggestion though. I would add the shadows to a light not attached to the camera.
Because when I am viewing the city in first person mode, the fact the shadows are constantly moving is a bit annoying. Not really a big issue of course.

Can't wait to see more !
great!!

Very nice Jerry.
I am making a quick week-to-week illustration with an odd version of the statue. Your model came in handy to find the right angle in the composition. Good for reference. Thanks.
Thanks silz. I'm glad it was useful. When I finally begin to gain some modeling skills I'd like to return to this and other Statue of Liberty models I've created and bring out the details I lost as I ran the photogrammetry software.
Cool model, I just downloaded it.
super!

I will try to rigg it and sell it in the sketchfab store :)!
Coooool,RPG feeling.
Your cats are just! ;_; ugh! They're so cute!

This is absolutely INCREDIBLE. Just everything about this model is solidly designed. Please upload more to Sketchfab! 

Also maybe show us how you make your textures literally perfect? Pretty please?
Wow cool job with the texturing! You got ourself another artstation follower :)
Did you do everything in Photoshop
Awesome amount of detail.
Hey thanks guys! much appreciated!  @essimoon This one was a combination of Photoshop and 3D Coat. I have WIP thread for this over on Polycount where I go into a bit more detail if its helpful or anyone http://polycount.com/discussion/171821/pixelatedkiwis-hand-painted-art-thread#latest
I really do not like it. Nope : I Luv it !. Amazing work :)
Thats amazing im new too 3d modeling still learning the basics so seeing this makes me want to improve
Amazing work!
What software did you use to model the character?
Holy moly that's uber good! Maybe some day i'll do something as good as this. This is over the top quality man!
Thanks guys, glad your digging it!  @revolsson 3DS Max for modeling this guy.
Awesome work man! I Love the painting job!
Amazing! love the details and concept

The models are so high mesh that every program I've tried crashes or reduces the quality to the point where I can't use it. Any suggestions on the easiest path to take to get to the point of 3D printing these great ship models?
@philrolfejr If you could get the program to accept the number of verts it would still have to be closed looped, which these models are not, and they would have to be printed in sections like models, IE the hull separate from the deck, gun turrets, and so on. I have been looking at these models in Blender an have noticed that they have multiple double verts. If the models in the game are the same its a shame because the amount of double and triple multiple verts is taxing on the game computers to run when the load could be lightened.
HaratioFales, thanks for the reply! I wish I knew more about meshes or I might have noticed an issue like that. I suspect these are the models they use but do not know for sure. I was expecting to print in sections, possibly using blender and Fusion but so far nothing but problems.

Great concept, great details and great texture work! :)
Fantastic, I nearly choked on my lunch when I saw this :)
Amazing texture work! I love it!!!
I just checked the concept that you were working off, perfect job dude, likeness achieved. :D
holy crap, that's some serious texturing. it looks like an illustration when it's still!
I'm keeping this open in browser tab just as a reminder of how cool 3D handpainted art can be. It somewhat a bridge between 3d and illustration!
Amazing work
Stunning mate. It's a really great model you did there !
Feel like wanna to live inside. Great concept! love it!
I also set up the scene for viewing in VR, you can easily do that from the VR tab in the 3D settings for future uploads.

Try visiting it on a Cardboard - it's awesome :)
Jesus Christ, one of the best 3d stuff I've ever seen... cap down mate, you hand drawn it to perfection imho... awesome!
Fantastic stuff!!!!
amazing. handpainted on photoshop or substance painter?
fantastic model and texture.
love the copper bits especially. i find them very hard to get them right.
keep up the great work
Amazing adaptation, very vibrant textures!
Nice)

Nice, and good work on the particles, the effect is cool!
Did you try to add some SSAO to add some contrast on the details ? 
I think it could make the model even better :)
@waleguene Thanks :) actually I hadn't enabled it :)
I played around with it and also enabled the blur and some other effects. I think it does look better. thanks for the tip
Totally want to see the rest of the dragon :D 
The little ember sparks give it quite the nice presentation.

Did you create a substance designer file for the great looking shards? Trying to create something similar but without any real luck :P
@dark-minaz thank you! 

well I don't actually work in substance designer, only substance painter... so the crystals were all done in painter. I'd be happy to share the file if you'd like to take a look at it
So it's a sort of smart mask?  

Well it would be amazing to have a look at that, might give me a few pointers in how i can make it in designer since they generally share most parts :)
@dark-minaz yeah.. it's just some smart masks and a bit of manual painting. Here's the SP file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxrrxj0XixjLb1dxWTVmS01vOXc/view?usp=sharing

Nice!
Great job on this! I really like the design!
May the force be with you, amazing work
Maybe a bit too revealing if it were to be used by Disney. But a wonderfull job regardless! Perhaps the lightsaber would have been cooler if it had a lighter core color. (More yellowish or something)
Oh, nvm your renders have the lightsaber EXACTLY the way i meant. :P
Sick model, love the looks of hair!

Thanks guys! :D
awesome work. 

Is it possible to make the light sabre blade part with a material that doesn't cast shadow?
And/or place a light source along the blade?
@aleahy nope. I did that in Marmo but here looks like it is impossible =\

Love it!!! How did you do that in Blender? Did you paint first in Affinity then Blender, or did you model in Blender then paint? I am trying to figure out your process, trying to do something similar :)
@rafaelmacho Hi, I wrote I little behind the scenes article here : https://www.blendernation.com/2019/02/06/behind-the-scenes-summer-color/

@mauricesvay Yeah he is great, thanx :D
Beautiful! Love seeing the watercolor effect in 3D. Perfect music too!
@seori Thought that animal crossing ost would fit perfectly thanx :D
I saw this on twitter, and I admit, it didn't register in my head that it was a 3D model at first
@kryik1023 that s good i guess :D
Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! Love the watercolour technique you used here!!
@curlscurly Thanx Curls, glad coming from you :D
Nice! Love the textures :)
@AliceJaunet Thank you ^^
This is awesome! Would you mind sharing how you create the watermark textures? Are you just using plain textures and water mark pencils on Photoshop?
@adrianmg Thats it, just simple plane texture in photoshop, with a custom organic watercolor brush, and paint like a normal texture unwrap.
Love it!
Wow this is amazing; the music and the style and the subject matter go together so well. I (and I think many others) would pay good money to play a slow paced, dialogue heavy, combat-less adventure game set in this kind of world.
@bevanmckechnie Thank you :D, yeah it could be so good something like that, will have that in mind.
tooo much soda
But look very good
@Doctor_Fastoss87 Thank you Fastos :D
@juanchodeth with two s on end :?

model looks amazing. I was wondering within the autodesk123DSculpt.mtl its trying to call the Untextured.png and running into problems bringing it up within virtual reality with it not showing up
@nebulousflynn do you still have the files for this? Or shall we redo for @paolo.ellucian to use the model?
Grandioso trabajo  saludos desde México.
Hey, I removed the categories Animals & Creatures,  Characters,  Products & Technology and  Science, Nature & Education. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
This is my favorite artifact in the British Museum, I would love to be able to 3D print one to keep in my house. Are the files still available?
Where did the stl go? ;(

She does very well in 3D!
Good job, one thing imo is that she looks a bit odd from other point of view like the side.
@enalya Thanks, nice to hear the remarks, I'm working on it now. In my next work, which I am currently preparing, I will try to make a better anatomy :)
I like it a lot. Did you plan to create stylised block-style eyelashes, or was it a compromise at some point?
Wow, this is a really great piece.

Feel very real
Amazing, the best human scan I've ever seen.
shared...
Thank you guys so much for the comments!
Would you tell us which tools/technology was involved? Thanks
what's the price? please share!
This one is not for sale! This scan was done for a prototype. We're making more of these, which will be available at our TurboSquid store. 
Check it out at: http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/ScanLab-Photogrammetry&referral=ScanLab-Photogrammetry
Did scanner do this ? I think mesh is too clean for a scanner. But the edge flow especially on the face isn't as good as if it was retopologized by someone.

great job .
i love it look really good i love the textures
How do I make this stuff
You don’t
I love your work!
How can I buy or download this?
@xkungwork It's an amazing texture job! you got way too many tris/polys on this though. you could have gotten this model done for under 10k polys. Why'd you decide to go this route?
Someone pls tell me how to download model introduced in this page? I don't know where to download.
@Kazuo_Kato 
This model can't be downloaded. They are not even selling it. The function of this model is just to promote the game.
Nice work!!!
nice!
wow good

It's so lovable!
@zinnfandel Aww, thank you!
How did you get the pokeballs have borders either way the camera faces? I though by simply ading borders on the models you can achieve the look but I am guessing there's more to it than meets the eye.
@redmdlee For the pokeballs and a few objects like tables and chairs I use an outline trick. You simple duplicate the same mesh, make it convex if possible, paint it the color you want the outline to be, make it a single face (or have some sort of backface culling)  and just invert the normals.

For you to see it in actions, create a cube or a box -> give it a color -> duplicate and just scale the model out without changing the position -> give it a black color -> check if your modeling engine can cull the backfaces, check for any options where you can determine the faces of this mesh to be single-sided -> invert the normals.

The other outlines I just painted them on the texture so it's a mix of hand-painted and that. I made these pokemon remake models free to download so you can download it and play around.

Good luck ahead~
Nice...
So cool :) Staff pick!

@Wesai I see, its not as hard as I imagined,

I have been looking for a lot of simple and low poly 3D art styles and so far I am in love the pixel style right now, so this will be a great help if ever I've decided to settle on this one.

Another question though, are the lights painted on the texture? Or are the shading the result of the light bouncing of the objects?

Thanks for the info and keep up the great work ^^
@redmdlee This scene has no lighting at all so I had to paint the different shades on the texture itself.
@bartv Whoa, thank you so much!
Is veri nice
Good stuff! But isn't this stuff copyrighted or something?
null
@deusexmachina This is fan art.
This is great! How do you keep the textures from smoothing out?
@slimjim3k Thank you! To keep the textures sharp you have to change their filtering mode to neareast. You can achieve this in Sketchfab going to 3D settings and changing the texture options there. It also works on your modeling software viewport / renders if you change the texture filtering mode there.
@Wesai Haha So simple! Well done! I will try to keep that in mind if I ever do something similar. Thanks!
so funny ! remember my childhood :D
How did you make that outline?
Also, how do you manage to keep the pixel size the same between all those different assets?
@danielsantalla About the outline I answered it to an older comment on the first page of this comment section, check it out~ Now about the pixel size, all the objects in my scene are laid out in the same UV. Keeping track of their size is easier, also if your objects have the right proportion to one another it won't be too difficult to tweak, it's a matter of giving more UV space or less.
@Wesai wow thank you! I loved all your pixel work. Your characters are awesome too!
Very cool method with the outlines!
You should upload your Pokemon Maps to VRChat and make Pixelated 3D Sprites. =)

Hey, I added the category Art & Abstract, and I removed the categories Animals & Pets,  Characters & Creatures,  Cultural Heritage & History,  Electronics & Gadgets,  Gaming and  Science & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.

Anyone else has got the same problem?

@stephomi Thank you! :D
Nice, I'm new want to start. what do you use to do this? Thanks Mitch
@MitchSmx Hey! I use a free 3D modelling application called Blender3D ( www.blender.org ) Its 100% free and no commercial limitations, make as much money with it was you want. Besides that i use a paid tool(set) called substance painter 2, and substance desinger 5, which both cost together around 200$. 

There are alot of tutorials on blender, personally i recommend by trying to figure out blender mostly yourself by googling the thing you need to know, tutorials wont hurt you especially the beginner one. 

Succes!
+1 for Blender and Substance Painter :)
@bartv BlenderAndSubstanceMasterRace :p
@dutchallians Cheers dude, any tutorials you would recommend?
@MitchSmx Hmmm. i really like the blender cookie one, usually filter on youtube on top rated when looking for tutorials thats how i found my favorite ones :p
I like the fact that it's single barreled, it makes look a lot more hand crafted and basic which fits Rust perfectly imo. Good work!
I'd take this single barrel over the pipe shotgun ;D
good realization of good idea!

@alban @bartv Thanks :) I need to see it in VR too now but I can't help but think about all the imperfections of the car being that much more noticeable

@matrix77 That's a good question. Maybe if it is an offer I can't refuse haha

Amazing! So clean...
What was xnormal used for? Does this model have a high poly version?
3@slava @doncha_magoso Thanks :)

@darius0005 Yep, I wasn't satisfied with some parts of the occlusion and normals I baked from Substance Painter so I used xNormal for those areas
@alankailei Yeah I'm trying to learn the most efficient approach and less time consuming one to bake high from low, so did you create a high poly version for the whole model or just parts and if so did you just use the same software this one was modeled in? Thanks.
@karolmiklas Me too
@bin381 haha thanks

@darius0005 I had a high poly of almost everything modeled in Maya. I think Substance Painter is pretty fast and efficient. Just the car had many pieces, I spent some time combining and naming every mesh to prepare for Painter and I found it quicker to use xNormal and Photoshop to correct some things.
really good work can't see any error on it.
perfect !
@alankailei Was the high poly reduced to make this one or was  it done from scratch ?
@blackantmaster Thanks, glad to hear that :)

@darius0005 I normally model in the middle so once I get a good base, I duplicate and high res it and I optimize the other
Extremely well done :-)
great!
As a car guy, love it, love it, love it. What a perfect MGB!

Now I'm wishing your creation would reach a wider audience. I'm sure there are MGB clubs worldwide whose members would go nuts over this.
@S_76 @tv2 Thanks :)

@kstadden That means a lot. Maybe I can post this on an MG forum. I'm already signed up to one when I was researching the car haha

So, there's a selfie stick with a phone in the static pose, but it's not in the idle animation, did you hide it somewhere or is there some way you excluded it from the animation I don't know about? I thought maybe you scaled it down and hid it inside some part of her but I wasn't able to find it haha. Great work overall.

It was sculpted directly in Blender with a lot of references from Google images on one side :)
Briefly: It is an AO mixed with some noisy texture and some subtle color variations painted directy in Blender, then mixed in PS. Then used the upgraded Sketchfab materials to fine tuning the shading stuff.
Beign sloppy did help, I didn't do proper topology nor unwrapping, also texture is quite basic.
Congrats again on this awesome model Julio, that's one of my favorites on Sketchfab! I even embedded it on my blog :) http://denoyel.com/post/65956024101/one-of-my-favorite-models-on-sketchfab

Also it has a funny interaction with the wireframe option.
great lens shaders. chromatic abb is a leeeetle high tho.  just my 2c.

Now you can download it, but bear in mind it's low poly and not intended to be printed, so unless it is really really small, you are going to miss most of the detail you see here.
download to my collection .

Nice work, Karol! I have some questions, how can add 3d models such as vehicles, planes, guns, clothes, atc... into the PUBG game? did you used editor to add them? what is the formats that PUBG game allow? what about polys and verts counts? actually I'm I interested to know how to do this, thank you in advance.
@arand4 Well, it's as PUBG imagined it, still keeping it's own character I think. ;)
@2dand3d Zima!
@SHUBBAK3D This model is the official one created for PUBG. I don't think it's possible to add your own models to the game.
null
@karolmiklas Well I know, still its quite obviously a copy xD

@SHUBBAK3D I have never played PUBG, but I know a thing or two about modding games in general, with my 15 year experience. As PUBG is a multiplayer game, it's not possible to modify it, in fact if you tried you would probably get a ban for trying to cheat, even if the modded vehicle only showed on your side.

Only place I could imagine Mods would be possible, would be in Private servers, if there is such a thing
Whao Karol!!, another amazing work, I really like your cars,
Awesome work!
I'm just curious, what the average amout of time you put on your models?
Blur in the corners of windows...That really looks like frosted glass...this is just insane. And all of this is runs in realtime in webbrowser on mobile phone.
What can we say Karol? Another impressive model. You'll need to build a trophy case for all the Staff Picks you've been collecting! Staff Pick!
Your body of work is astounding and your efficient use of the polygon is mind blowing!
We featured your model on Twitter!

https://twitter.com/Sketchfab/status/1101421884846022657
Where do you get reference for things like the frame and the suspension?
So perfect, as allways!
Awesome. should make a few of these and sell in your store. some cars in ur store is too clean for my liking.

I want to take a dive and fall to the infinite void below.
Very very nice indeed. Staff picked!
Thank you all very much, to everyone for your interest in my work. But this interesting thing is that this work was only a test animation. I checked morphing. Others of my work, I think deserve more interest. But, but alas. Paradox. :-)
opened for download
thank for your generosity and I will tell my small opinion:
of course we see that the morphing is great, the lightning too,
but what I feel very artistic is that we have a samlle piece of ocean, witch supposed to be an immensity, the paradox is here , and I love it! :)

ps: I told sketchfab team several times , lol , to add sound! :)
Thanks,awesome job
Thank you and awesome job it is.. But I didn't get animation in unity.. please help me out
Really nice. Congrats
I'm having difficulty viewing this, is it broken? I've tried multiple computers and phones.
@minecraftnorge im having the same problem
Very good simulation and material. Works perfect.
Thanks for allowing us a peek under the hood. Beautiful motion. What software was this created in?
Waves in 3D-worlds could learn from this on how to behave... you did a marvelous job compared to other waves I've seen... it is worth the credits.

best aurora model
I know it is probably meant to prevent plagiarism, but I was wondering if you could make this file downloadable. It would be cool to have a small model of the Aurora on my desk or something, you know?
If only this model was downloadable for those of us who wish to use it for a 3d print...

Bro you saved me with this...  thanks!!!!
Thanks
For some reason when I import it to unity I when I put it in the scene, it's a model of a woman standing
Very nice work, Thank so much for let us download it :)
Thanks so much, this is a beautiful castle... Thank you for the download!! Happy Thanksgiving!
thank you so much.very nice work
???????~?????!!
Created account just so I could download this :) nice work indeed
Very strange experience here. My download gives me a RAR file named 866d842e0b824c1bb8088ef917787eea. And that has within a file named cinderella castle but the object that produces, in both Poser and Blender, is a 2d silhouette of a woman holding a tray or some such. It's only 9548 kb. The mtl file is only 2 kb-yet in Poser I see reference to 9 or 10 materials.  Any idea what's going on here? I unzip using 7zip, and have done nothing else here, no re-naming of files, no weird filing paths, that might confuse things.
I do still want the castle, if anyone can help sort this out. Thanks.

@rawrsoft Placing the models, applying textures, and most of all baking, baking and baking :p Lasers are also made in blender. Basically magica makes the voxels, Voxelshop turns into meshes, and blender is for making the scene :)
Rest in pieces :)

This is really nice! did you use a greeble to make the deathstar part?
@corentin that line is actually from Expandables 2 ;D Made me laugh really hard at the time xD

@rawrsoft Porkins is just ahead of the annotation 6... he wants his cookies back, man!

@LentzMarseill thanks! Actually... I don't want to spoil anything, but there should be a tutorial soon about this, and the deathstar parts are part of it ;) Just waiting for reviews from the sketchfab team :)
@mrbones thanks!
I love the humor :)
Epic scene!
That is very good
This is epic, wow! I love the use of annotations and how it adds to the action.

SO COOL!
Wow, very impressive use of annotations to move THROUGH the model! And DOF too. NICE!
Sketchfab upload and archive. What format do I use? I use bake, what, ply format, and how to add material. I can't add up, ask for help, thank you.

@martinallen you're looking for daz 3d which has models you can pose and import a bg into  and render or reference your camera angles. It's free for the most part. There's also poser which is also really good for referencing models. Not free though. And there is also ArtPose which is for mobile devices.

wow its so nice i love your work
That is one incredible tortoise. Such a noble animal.
thanks @freewaysgoodies and @mobidextrous - probably not 100% accurate but a good experiment :)
This is a remarkable piece.  For the underside, do you flip the piece over and then shoot it again and then merge the image?  B
hi @bdnewnan this model was not made using photogrammetry - although I would love to scan a giant tortoise!

There is a link in the description to the piece of web software: Smoothie3D
Its beautiful
Thank you very much! Good job.
@wuct88 @Juju2703 thanks!
Title's not accurate ! This tortoise is not a Giant ! Or you really have to zoom in on it.... Great work :) Never heard of this smoothie online modeling tool before. Sounds funny.
@hansolocambo hehe - thanks! I am more of a 3D scanner normally but Smoothie 3D is pretty simple to use... so even I could create a (medium size) tortoise :)
This kind of a turtle i like most.thank you
thanks @leonalkalai - glad to share it with you :D
Funny thought, scanning a tortoise...I know they are slow, but how fast is a scan?
thanks for comment @johndconnaughton - this isn't actually a scan! There's a link in the description to the software I used to make this (it was for a competition here on Sketchfab a while ago)
Beautiful job!!!

Looks like something out of Corpse Party.  I love it.
I'm a really big fan of the lighting in this scene, great work!
Fantastic scene! I like a lot the textures and lighting.
Kinda Silent Hill-ish :)
Vraiment sympa, l'éclairage et l'ambiance, bravo !!
Nice!
@airis Thank you, glad you like it :)
@kryik1023 Thank you, I attach great importance to the lighting, so I'm happy you like it!
@eraso Thank you for your kind comment, much appreciated :)
I like the overall atmosphere, the plants in the floor are nice extra details that help sell the deserted/abandoned feeling.
Like a lot the scene and the theme! and I´m a architecture´s fan. Also I´m kind of perfeccionist though, so two little observations if I may: the windows on the door have not so well defined texture; and the plants growing only there most have some moisture around, maybe a wet wood under them? or a broken cristal in the window? Just to perfeccionist I am I know D: 
Beside that I can tell you this is a very nice proyect!
Bravo,  Excellent job, If I may mention small comment. Despite all the destruction, the list on the left wall (beside the door) and the two Exit Signs have not been affected at all!
I've featured your work on BlenderNation:

great job on texturing!! i was surprise to see how few polygons you hav in here!! looks great!!
@jesset Thank you very much for the great feedback!
@alexcosio 
Thank you for your comment. You have keen eye for details and I'll try my best to do better in my next scene :)
@beslar You're absolutely right, my mistake. But thank you for the feedback, this will help me to pay more attention to this kind of details and get more realistic next time!
@bartv Oh that's great!! Thanks a lot, much appreciated!
@twitte_king Thank you very much!! I made some retopo on the debris and curtains to lower the number of polygons - I have to improve the process though ;)- Cheers

Thanks for making this available!
@ledante It's my pleasure :)
You guys are a genius. This is awesome. I wish I could have done 3d models like that. Thanks for nice art pieces that inspire me.
@erkankusku you can do that. just follow my workflow video. 
that's why i made it~ to help for creative work.
@moondonghwa Thank you, Moon. It is great video channel that I will follow.
Awesome work!  Any chance you'd be interested in offering this as an embedded model in a 3D software package?
@bustapixel you can do that. :)
Awesome!
It is a great model, good job!
@chrislin thanks~ :)
Wow, you've reached 3000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

The model is so clean! Great work!

Good work!
@lenatodd thanks :D
Amazing! Can it be used freely for anything? In what program did you make this? I just started out with iClone and Blender, total noob hoping to learn from anyone:-) Take care all the best Albin

@FilipAAOfficial Hey, sorry for the late response. Sure use it however you like!
Hi! i need to print right now this! how can I change the extension of the file to stl? thanks!!!
@bowen94 Hey, I'm sorry, but this model isn't prepared or 3d printing, thus converting to an .stl file wouldn't you much. If you want to print this model, some significant work would be needed to prepare it.
@bowen94 If you want to convert it, export it in blender
How long have you been working on Blender?
@NudnyMongol I've ben working with Blender for about 5 years now. When I made this model I had about 2 years with it.
This is awesome.
I've tried like five falcons and this is the best, thank you! Merry Xmas!

Hey! That's very cool! Tell me...I have MagicaVoxel (free) but the file is in .vox and this website don't recognize it. How can I upload my renders here?
@Kimchian Thank you! Maybe this guide can help you: https://blog.sketchfab.com/complete-guide-importing-magicavoxel-sketchfab/
@elbriga Ooow thanks, that is helping me so!
Sketchfab upload and archive. What format do I use? I use bake, what, ply format, and how to add material. I can't add up, ask for help, thank you.
@fkf hi, maybe the forum will be a better place to ask for advice or help. You wiull get an answer for sure. No use spamming comments.
That you just say, I magicavoxel file should save what format, and then send to sketchfab, (I have made the material well)thanks


There's a game in the future city. I think it's only night view to show the feeling of the future city, thank you.
Was this just achieved with  MagicaVoxel? What did you use for post porcessing?

It is unfair that I have so many downloads and very few like, Sketchfab managers would have to say how to solve this, that for each download it is mandatory to leave a like
@metatrox .blend is native for free blender

EXCITMENT! hes uploading more then useal
you should take a break and spend christmas with family/friends instead of on a computer making models
I think your's might be better than Maximo's one....maybe
WOW ^-^
aaand hes back to being a jerk not uploading FAWK
The one thing that 16nis the twat fucked up about 
......................................... MAXIMO ALREADY MADE THE MODEL YOU FUCKING TWAT BITCH YOU CAN MODEL SO FASTER THEN YOUR TWAT ASS
I MEAN MAXIMO CAN MODEL FASTER YOU TWAT
JESUS CHRIST FUNNYSTUFF he is making models for the map of FNAF2 not for ragdolls *atleast yet* those ones by maximo and smoke and just for modeling so shut up brat
@thefunnystuff58
Leave this comment section to his model and maximo may have already modelled this but 16nis has a better reputation and he is being paid to make these models
can you make the puppet head on it's bodie
@thefunnystuff58 Calm down. Not everything is a competition. Your acting like I6NIS said Maximo sucked at 3d modeling. Besides, I6NIS was busy modeling the other characters.
LISTEN EVERYBODY,STOP MAKING A FUSS ABOUT MAXIMO!!!FerventFlames is right and he is not publishing them until he finishes all of it,jeez louweeze give him good reviews,anyways if 16nis's model is worse,JUST USE THE OTHER!16Nis,Don't listen to haters
why is EVERYONE MAKING A FUSS ABOUT MAXIMO ANYWAYS?! I WAS NOT HERE DURING THIS STUPID , RETARDED ARGUEMENT!! JESUS F*CKING CRIST
sorry if i started a completly different arguement,,,,,,,i just wanted to know
omg the puppet modle is so cool
you cant have a marionette with out the marionette eyes marionette was a kid

Yep ... what can I say ... Epic Scene ! 10/10 ign

Don't hesitate to add some more stuff to anything you post on sketchfab, I will be here to like it :D
Another great one! Please post more of these, I love them! <3
I don't know why this one has less likes than the other one... probably just randomness. Both are equally great.
@JoseDiaz Don't know, but I guess people like cute! :)

So good! Staff picked!
Yesssss!
Good work. Just a question: How was it made? Is it a decimated sculpture from ZBrush? I am asking because of the apparent untidy topology. Still, it looks great!
thank you guys

E lynx, Daniel, I did dynamesh+decimation, that's why there's no topology. And it's baked from my original render: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rRaee
How did you get the toony/black outline on sketchfab? is that part of the bake?
Hey jesper. You have to duplicate the main mesh, make it bigger (as much as you want), invert the normals and use a black material. It's very simple. :)
WOOAA!! This is awesome!!
that's a really cool technique. Thanks for the insight, was wondering how people were getting that toon shader effect. Really loving everything about this. Are you planning on giving him his boots as well?
looks very awesome

wow, cool technique! Thanks a lot for sharing.
It's realist and cartoon and the same time and it's well balanced. Great! That's difficult to achieve.
very very good !!! :O Its excellent for a Dargon ball game!
Good job!
At this point, I think without the toonshader it would look a lot better, the dark lines kind of flatten your nice volumes...

@TiagoMedeiros Thank you very much, Tiago :)
Pretty cool.
Awesome quality! I posted a slighty edited version here for 3D printing: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2446189

Did you touch up a lot of areas where info was missing or was most of the sculpture processed by Reality Capture?
@3dwp Thanks!
There was no touch-up, the normal map was backed from a raw mesh (simplified to around 30mil) with a little extra displacement from texture to bring out tiny details. Decimated to 160K in ZBrush.
Thanks   very cool!
VERY  SPECIAL!
Moving, Thanks for sharing!
Awesome!! You got the essence of this statue. Even better than the original.

from Wikipedia - 
While Picasso was living in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II, one German officer allegedly asked him, upon seeing a photo of Guernica in his apartment, Did you do that? 

Picasso responded, No, you did.


I got chills!
@chaitanyak Indeed, Guernica is one of the most iconic antiwar art masterpiece worth studying. Hopefully we remember our history well to make art, not wars.
Letting you know this was featured on IAMAG's Sketchfab Realtime Selection! Congrats!

@seori As always, thank you! :)
Pablo Ruiz Picasso, 
Great job.
@crazymanuel Indeed.
Amo questo lavoro, grazie
@g.andreani48 Grazie!
Amazing work! Would you like to show some works in a VR art show that I am putting together?
@godfreymeyer Thanks. Sorry I have no plan to participate in any VR show beyond sharing via Sketchfab.
Really cool work you do!

Ok¡¡
They look ok just because of the texture, without it - 3d models are quite poor quality - sadly :(
Where are the other 82 pieces... did England steal them?
Yes, England stole them. At least 3d scan them all and in a decent format. :\

Great idea, I love it.
Ok, both as a fan of xkcd and just in general, I've got to say: this is pretty freaking sweet.
Very clever. :)
I so totally want to print this out as a 3D-diorama!!!
Awesome! lovely shader, i've always struggled to make this comic look. would love to know how-to.
@cptEric It's fairly easy, honestly. They are all shadeless, one-sided materials. In order to make the comic border you just need to make a copy slightly bigger and invert the normals.
Love this! I'd really like to try it in room-scale MR with our ZapBox kit. If you're up for it, can you tick the button to make it downloadable? I'd obviously give full credit to both you and xkcd.

More about ZapBox on Kickstarter here: http://kck.st/2f0ddUV

Hey Aleksei,

My name is Thomas Verplancke, I'm a representative of Tanks Encyclopedia (http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/). We're a website that is dedicated to presenting the history and importance of AFV, along with specs, photos and illustrations, with some 5000 visitors/day.
However, recently, we have started experimenting with adding 3D models as well (http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/Sweden/Swedish-prototypes-paper-projects.php).

Your T-34/85 is an impressive 3D model which we liked very much! And as such, we'd like to invite you to join the Tanks Encyclopedia team. We'd like to feature your model (and any others you produce) on our website  and help you with documentation for future ones (plus an article, photos and illustrations). Obviously the models remain your property, and proper credit will be given wherever necessary. Feel free to look around on the site, and don't hesitate to contact us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Tanks-Encyclopedia-616022298486886/) or via sketchfab!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Thomas Verplancke
5,000 triangles, brilliant.  If this makes it into my game, you will get full credit, for sure. Really good job.  This compares very well against a 50k model and your wheels/tracks look BETTER!

how do I credit you?
when you download it you copy the credit and paste it in your work (i think)
Great model.
wow
how can i download it?
wow. Nice tank.

May i use it in my game?  What should i do for the permission?
@Smith.Jason  Whats the game like?
@90champthe3rd  It's a mobile game of World War II.

Move the tank and shoot at others.

Thanks a lot for posting this ship. I am a 3d modeler student. Very very helpful for me.
i believe germany should have built more carriers.
@tanklover they don’t build any, this one was only 80% completed by the end of the war
@Renland they should have started in 1938
Yes, and or they should have buddied up with the Japanese sooner. They could have learned more about Carrier, and or Carrier operations. The Italians would have been wise to do that also. They built Aquilla, (Eagle in Italian) it basically ended up like Graff Zeppelin. Was mostly complete but never went anywhere, and the Italians never really developed aircraft for her.

Would this work for motion capture using Motion Live with iclone 7 (for instance)?

Hi, I could not contact you directly, so I just want to notify that I'm using your assets on a third person shooter game called: Mercenaries Land.

Thank you for share these amazing assets that you are creating. I can't pay you now for them, but I hope I will in the future when the game start making money.

If you want to check the progress of the game, check the website www.MercenariesLand.com and if you want you can add me on Steam. I'm the guy who talked with you about Unity Connect there.

Best Regards.

Inspiring!  Im going to do an impossible geometry model. you should change the title to Escheresque
Best appreciated in first person viewer mode. One thing you should do make multiple Uv maps and for each map bake with different light positions. Although I think you did that right?
hi eliut, thank you!
I've already baked shadows and ambient occlusion (the dark lines you see somewhere on the models are the UV seams).

Of course as of today Sketchfab has a lot more advanced shaders and I should probably rebuild this scene with more interesting materials... I will :)

What are you working on? I'm curious!
Hello, I did a model of a small plant, I used that for a piping design course I gave here in Mexico. At first I thought about using Navisworks or something like that. But Sketchfab works perfectly, the model shows real piping, in 1 to 1 scale. Now I am doing a small house, with furniture. I believe this technology haves lots of potential, problem is that a lot of people (at least here in Mexico) dont know about it.
I think I am going to do a tutorial in spanish to fix that.

Cheers!

Nice work. It looks organic but still module based. I could see a whole world beong developed efficiently in this style.
love it!
beautiful!! Love the rocks!
Amazing work here! 

How did you create this? I'm quite interested in what the process was if you're willing to share :)
Really nice! It deserves a staff pick.
Thank you everyone! Thank you Bart! :) @winterslocke basically it's always the same. Start by choosing a system for building levels. Then build very basic geometric blocks / box volumes for all the elements you want to have in the set test how they fit and work together. Then comes the actual object modeling to replace the boxvolumes, then texturing then some tweaking of the models again for deformations and details. After that... build a test level to double check if nothing got messed up in the process! :)
I'm assuming the floor is done with a modular system? I've been looking for a good way to vertex paint different textures in Sketchfab but the only thing that came up was to bake it.
Amazing work!
Please, if you could, do a step-by-step tutorial ! ;)
You've been featured on 80.vl, congrats :)

https://80.lv/articles/best-of-sketchfab-ladies-clouds-starships/
Can't help but marvel at your work! For me, your well over level 100
Awesome models,  but  49$ for that...??  You are breaking the market  and  not respect Your own talent.

Me encanta este tipo de cosas, muy buen trabajo!!
Great model?
spiraled trees with self illuminated leafs)! Interesting idea!
Lokks good, my only critique is that the lighting could be brighter.
@artbalanced Thanks man! Also the crit is much appreciated, I'll keep that in mind for my next projects :)
OMG how did you make that red leaves?
@hamyung_x Just made an emission map with colors brighter than the ones on the albedo map. I find that using the same color as the albedo doesn't work as well as using a slightly brighter color. :)
Crazy! Fantastic model!
Very nice. have you tried an animated texture on the water?
@Colmhd Cheers! It's definitely something I want to implement to the scene for when my schedule clears out a bit :)
Wow really cool!
@DANBEE360 Thank you very much, it means a lot :)
This is so amazing, for sure one of the best diorama's I have ever seen on here, it's genuinely beautiful, I love it!!!!!!

Love it ! you made me want to try to make something like this haha
cool
this is so great! do you mind sharing the workflow of softwares you used?
@rebeccapark Hey, thank you so much and sorry for the late reply! I used Maya for the modelling bit and photoshop and substance painter for the textures maps. :)
i love it
seriously, it's unreal, is it possible to make something this good, awesome bro... ?

@ezertuche23 I agree, now the mesh mesh is generated directly in the RC. Do you think the basic mesh generated from Hi model in Instant Meshes app will work better?

Hi, can I use it in a video game? Is very amazing!
@aidentwosouls Hi, Yes ! I will like the picture from the game !

Thank you. Downloaded and converted to OBJ.
Hi!

I've reprocessed some of your models, and published a collection of lowpoly sticks - mainly yours - here if you are curious : https://skfb.ly/6yMP6 ( stones also https://skfb.ly/6yMPo )
Thanks very much for making your great and precise scans downloadable, I guess that they prove very useful for many!

Cheers, and keep up the good work!
Gracias

Can ? use in my video game ? And my game must be free ? (GREAT WORK !)

Yeah, I think it's a matter of self illumination, or maybe the fact that texture's lighting isn't neutral.

Very few people would find it to be relevant, and it would throw your viewers off(as you always do) My name is Joey Depeter. I have no offering though.

I can't wait to get my grabbers on the artbook ever since I saw this bugger on polycount a long ass time ago!
Felt good to secure a copy by finally backing it <3

thanks guys!
I like the texturing work and the cartoony proportions! Hope you upload more of the game's art. Might definitely get you a couple of backers, even more if they get staff picked :)
That's great! Staff picked.
OMG! This is so awesome! Cant wait to get the game!
Looks nice,a lot similar to spiral knights
He's so tiny in game! Is this really the LOD you are using for gameplay or is this subdivided up one level for sketchfab? I would assume 5k is much more reasonable than 20 at that scale. This could be the cutscene LOD?  (looks great btw, I'm just always curious about polycount)
That is such a cool character concept!

Hola, antes que todo decir que me encanta tus modelos. Empezé hace no mucho a lo que se refiere al mundo del diseño; yo trabajo con 3Ds Max, y estoy muy interesado en conseguir tutoriales para crear modelos al más puro estilo anime usando este software, pero no encuentro ninguno, solo para blender, con el cual he trabajado un par de veces. Estaría muy agradecido si me brindaras tu guía y ayuda para crear modelos como los tuyos algun día. Muchas gracias.

Ich finde die Nebelmaschine super! Ich bin gerade dabei, einen Online 3D-Raum zu bauen für meine Seite www.drunkbeatz.com - könntest du dir vorstellen, dass ich das Model der Maschine dafür benutzen kann? Könnte gegen Beats tauschen, falls du dir das vorstellen kannst? Wäre super, wenn du dich meldest - meine Email ist drunkbeatzdiggi@gmail.com

@drunkbeatz Hi Moritz

Sorry das ich so spät antworte, bin nicht oft auf SketchFab, ja du kannst die Nebelmaschine gern benutzten

I am currently beginning to study graphic design and looking 3d figures and I found yours. 
They are really nice!!!
I usually only in areas with wifi internet, so it makes me difficult to use sketchfab. 
I sent a message to the manager asking if it was possible to download the models you liked, in order to enjoy them without internet. 
I said it was not possible, but most users are open to facilitate model if asked privately in a comment. 
I wonder if it would be possible to have the model so you can use it without internet. 
Really thank you very much, I hope your answer.
Beautiful and creative!
So where is the download button?
Oldie but a goodie - I love this model so much. Staff Picked!

I can see how this place would be so great a defensive position even today.
If you do such a thing like this you need to pay more attention to the vertical straight lines 
and to the correct horizont. It's so disappointing...

Looks great, but unable to reduce the number of veriticies without the mesh becomes a cloud of triangles. Is it possible to clean the texture for the top of the head? Thanks for the model!
So let me get this straight there is no model model WITH the textures applied  Just an untextured  model amd a png file. Has anyone made one with the textures attached please? We have a virtual museum we would like to use to display the finalised model please visit at http;//wa692.avayalive.com and here is a YOUTUBE video of a walkthrough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgdF4042irU
    The museum is open to everyone 24/7 there is a small plugin and it can take up to 20 visitors at one time
The link for the texture is on the right side of the page --> 

Mapping is already on the model, so you just have to add the texture to your material and away you go.
Modello molto ben definito! Complimenti!
Really realistic
Brilliant work on this, mate - many thanks :)

Will work on turning it printable in the upcoming days.
Would love to see a quick walkthrough of the process! I've been considering trying to reconstruct from video myself.
Amazing quality mesh from such a low quality video data source. Would your point cloud extraction technique work if Obama's mesh video was shown in perspective view instead of parallel? I noticed VisualSFM struggles with images taken at a wide lens angle, generating slightly warped point clouds even at 50+ mm focal length.
doesn't look anything like him in the file
tried several times to download but nothing happened
Good transfer (considering the source), but the result isn't pictured.  It looks very different.
DOPE
????? ?????!!!!!!!
Louis,  great work! 
I have tried several times to download this (low poly too) but no luck
haha very intelligent way to capture ! Lot of job, Download the video, extract frames from selected range. Openning in Agisoft and go ! Nice job

Hey Renafox, wonderful model, as a hobby game maker just wanted to tell you in a developping way, it would be just a way better if you would create the wheels of your cars seperated from the car so that to be well-used in a game your models could be animated as drivable..Just an idea :)
Hi, your work is featured on 3D-Station!

http://www.3d-station.fr/2016/11/25/sketchfab-modeles-mois-decembre-2016/

Enjoy :)
@Bart 

Oh wow, I'm apparently popular in france now, haha
@marcvernhes They are seperate from the car tho aren't they?
hey im new to this and tbh this is pretty cool
null
It's a good day whenever Rena releases a new model! <3

I like the little icon on the back, good job!
null
@ryanwoodcock 
No, that's the point. Renafox's models are in one mesh. If the wheels woulb be seperated, I (and others too) could animate them as movable/drivable in game engines (making them roll for example). Open the model in Blender, then you'll see.
@marcvernhes Yes, the vehicle is collapsed to one object, but the the wheels are entirely seperate sub-objects from the chassis. The wheels are not vertex-welded to the axles.
@kryik1023 
Sorry to insist but that's the point. Some models have the wheels as seperated object just like for example here the plane is another object as the car and so I could animate the car. How can I do this as collapsed ? I don't know that...
@kryik1023 
Maybe it would be better not to collapse ? :)
nice  vehicle asset it is my friend
Awesome! :)
@marcvernhes Well, in Maya, for example, it's a question of one click. What would be the point? To save the time? If you can't do that one simple tweak, you would be probably unable to use the model in game anyway. The model is free and very good. Stop complaining. ;-)
@marcvernhes Maybe you should go and model things for yourself instead of insisting something from people who are kind enough to give their work for free..
I love your style. And yet more I love seeing it evolving with time. :) 

The only complains from my side are baking errors - especially bumper corners - one more section and it would work out smoother. The wireframe topology, it's very chaotic. While it's very clean and consistent in the front, the rest of the vehicle seems to be very chaotic in that matter. 

Another area to improve is polygon distribution, a good example are the wheels: you can clearly notice the edges on their outter perimetter, while the inner circles, still using the same amount of divisions, seem to be more detailed (the wheel center).

It's a good job nonetheless and I hope to see more coming! :)
@marcvernhes - If using Blender 3d, select the areas/faces you want to separate then hit [ctrl]+P. Then separate the selection into its own mesh.
I love this model! Are you sure you haven't watched Stranger Things yet? ;)
@ Astro1derboy: Thank you :)
@ieva_lickiene: I don't understand what is the problem with asking ? I did not make anybody bad that I should go modelling myself  ? You know I can't model anything if you are interested for this; I'm enjoying scripting. And I 'm very happy with what Renafox does for free.

@Araon: Sorry but I do not use Maya. If it had be so simple for me to do a mouse click to solve this, well I would not have asked, you ?

Thx all for your answers.
Honestly I fail to see why people are complaining when something is provided as free
I'm very sorry if certain persons understood what I asked as a complain, that was not my intention, I was looking for help to let me use those fantastic models in my project.
@Astro1derboy
Little correction: Only press P (without ctrl) and the wheels or selected mesh will be a new object :)
Here is what I was looking for:

@alban Great ! :D
@bartv Thanks !
Wow.. cool animation bro!!.

I am traying to export animation from Blender to Sketchfab but, I have Blender 2.71 and I get not to export correctly.
Can you help me ge me some tips?

have a good day!
@romeropictures Thank you :)

Then, before to export my animated models in fbx format  (animation is currently supported for the FBX format only) with Blender, for a model with an armature like my spider, i bake the animation for each bone.

I select every bone of my armature and in the 3D View window menu, I click on pose > Animation > Bake Action, then in the little window called bake action, I define the duration of my animation and I check all the checkboxes (Only selected', visual keying, etc.) and I click the pose button. 

To export in the fbx format I change the fbx version to FBX 6.1 ASCII, and I uncheck empty, camera and  Default take. 

Of course you have to be a beta tester of the animation on sketchfab. It's possible to become a beta tester by filling a form that you can find on this page : https://sketchfab.com/animation

I hope my explaination will help you.
Love this!!
:D
This is epic!
Thank you @joshuawhittaker , @iggy-design ! :)
that detail!

what'd you use for this?
Oh god i hate spiders and love that animation! =)
A great spider and wonderful animation indeed!
Thanks guys !
WOW.. WOW!!!! :)
I love this model, i saw it again today after Midday after some months ago.., but then some Minutes ago.., behind my PC Screen a Spider walks like your towards me...
brrrrr... your model doesn't look only real, it seems it got real and come out of my PC Screen..,

I hate Spiders.. waaah..

Awesome work!
@gabegnlz Thanks!
Apology on the thumbnail. Just can't get it working no matter how many times I take the screenshot.
One Word: Wow...

You are TRULY talented!!
@InfinitiART Thanks! :)
I don't know why, but I can't see this model at night :)
It makes me a little afraid
E Lynx, you're just a great artist
Oh god, this is truly beautiful.
I'm voiceless ! That's an impressive work, well done !
Superb, once again! Another staff pick :)

How much time do these scenes take you?
@boittemike1 @smokefumus @happy32x Thanks!
@bartv Thanks for the staff pick. Each took about 2-3 weeks including research & plenty of slacking off. :)
this is amasing
@adamnsexyname thanks!
Fixed quite a bit of issues today. Seemingly more popping up if I keep looking at it. :)

Dear Somnit,

The alpha is a little off because of our order-dependent transparency. This will be fixed in a future upgrade, but for now you might want to consider separating the hair and collar into different meshes.
Thanks for the info Padre! I did import the hair and color as separate parts in a multi-part obj. I'm not sure if this is what you mean though.
People on Reddit like it ! :) http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/2lval1/lyndis_fire_emblem_by_christophs_3d_model/
Yeah, I see that they are a separate part ( http://cl.ly/image/2r283k0m1I0Y ) but I think the result might be better if you break it up even more (the hair one part, the collar one part, etc.)

But I could be wrong... We're planning to revamp transparency soon, so stay tuned for that :)
Maël N. that made my day. 

Thanks PadreZippo, I'll see if I can't find some time to try that. I look forward to seeing the transparency update :)
Your work is featured on It's Art Magazine, nice job! http://www.itsartmag.com/features/sketchfab-real-time-3d-models-selection-5/
I saw your work featured on Twitter earlier this evening and It's all very impressive! Great work on all the texturing
Thanks for the heads up Bart and baconchaney! I had no idea, haha. That's pretty cool.
Hey, I started a forum thread collecting 'Evil Angel' figures on Sketchfab! Feel free to add yours too :)

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/evil-angels-on-sketchfab/717
@bartv I completely missed your message. Just added the model now. I hope it's okay that I was late haha.
Brilliant, thanks :)
The middle finger have too much carpals, but in general is awesome! Congrats!
@kevinheiwart Yes, good point. Thanks for the input!
I never Played Fire Emblem be for, but I love the Design on this Character. And the why she's holding her swords, Awesome.
@2-Head_Dragon Sorry I missed your comment but I agree the design is cool. Not sure I did it justice but fun all the same. I do recommend playing the game :)
Would you be able to make this model downloadable? I'd love to print it out and paint it! Excellent job by the way!
@gibby707 Glad you like the model. Honestly though this isn't very printable. Most of the details are baked into the normal maps and the mesh isn't watertight.
I can't find the download. It says its only 250 k for the download. Do you have a mirror?

I have always been a huge fan of your work. You do an awesome job with everything. :) I was wondering on what program software are you using to create these 3D models.
@whitewolfspirit768 Hello there! :) I'm glad to hear you enjoy my works, thank you!
I use Autodesk Maya and ZBrush for the models I've posted here.
@werethrope That's very cool. I'm surely but very slowly wanting to do animation work and I'll be honest, I didn't know what to look for. I hope all is well with you and I hope to see Troxo as well soon too. Have a awesome day my friend. :)
Are you open for commissions? I would love a facerig by you! :3

GREAT job!  :O Got any tips on how to model more oragnic shapes and fur rendering ?  Also how did you go about the rig ?
Just realisted you had used texture for the fur, but any tips on that  ?
@felixcani Hmm, tips for organic modeling I'd probably advice try to retain edge creases and don't overly smooth your mesh. As for texturing… Photoshop's high pass are your best friend for extracting texture details, the rest are just like regular photo montage patching them up.
Nice fur trick, Staff Pick !
@paul_sketch Thanks Paul~!
His eyes look amazing and the fur texture turned out super nice!
The fur texture is amazing! Do you have any reference for creating this?
@louis2009 Thanks, character reference are written in the description.
@curlscurly Thank you~!
I cant understand 
How i can download it?
@ILYAILYAILYA You can't, tt's not available for public download because the character is own by my client.
As an animator I am frustrated that I cannot have this rig! Great job!
Can i have model sheet of it? It's so cute :(, pls share with me model sheet
Are you welling to make another Avi for vrchat If so plse hit me up i wanna talk with you if you would be willing ^^
Nice job and It's so cute!

Amazing Model! Texture work is incredible!
Super cute!
I would love to see how you made the textures, they look amazing.
I've looked up marble foxes and discovered them to be fox breeds made specifically for domestication. In other words, you can only find them as pets; they don't exist naturally in the wild.

The characterization is incorrect, by the way. The reference picture implies someone of maturity; he's just portrayed as a super deformed character within the picture, itself. What's more, the characterization show signs of him being a feminine (particularly around the eyes.)

It seems that the reference picture makes him as though a womanizing rich boy who lives the high life. This goes beyond the plate he wears and the champagne he's drinking, the money in the background and what's implied to be women who want to have sex with him; even his body language conveys this character. (Body language, by default, reflects self-image, how a character sees themselves. This is one of the sure-fire tells of a person's character; there's a reason why some say body language is the best tell to what the person is actually like.)
null
Hi, I was playing with the model and noticed you could see his body through his clothing. Haha. :-) Why did you add stuff that would be hidden anyway?
<3
@petersw79 What if he wants to change the clothes ? What if he needs to show the clothes-off version ? Plus it's not a low-poly version so no need to hide the body and it makes it a bit more realistic and well-made.
@CopycatDesign, yeah I suppose you're right.

Is there a blob floating above the footstand?
Awesome work
@miguelbandera The quality of the capture is incredible! Do you use flash..or natural light? Do you always use a tripod? The coverage is so good on this model I was wondering if you had it on a turntable or something? I've has some good results with Photogrammetry but nothing even close to this.

my personal taste makes me want to criticize the skimpy clothed combat female trope but I can't help but praise the fact that she actually has mag pouches for her ammo and that they're actually attached to MOLLE webbing. That alone makes this design 10 times more practical than half the stuff out there, even with the lack of clothes. So kudos :P

I also like the stand used it almost give the model a look of a collectible figurine also nice work
@Dragonite246 

Roughly, I was often used as a reference the ohter Game Characters.

For example...
Syndicate (Starbreeze Studios),PSO2(SEGA),etc...

Thank you for your comment!

your welcome about the comment also would you be willing to give me feedback on my own models so that i know improvements i need to make to them. Nice model as always keep up the good work
Wow she looks so amazing and real!
Did you design her? :)
[Update]

Thanks for looking my models.
I've adjusted the following points...

-Ready for VR (I've checked at Gear VR.)
-Environment Color, Lightings

Have fun!
@kashu 
Thanks for saying so!
Yes, I've designed. It's the original works.
(I am sorry for my late response.)
Very cool! I like the collectible style pose and the direction you took with the hair.
Very inspiring
Hi awesome, do you use zbrush to make the hair then bake the normal map ,right?
@jab92 
Thanks for your comment!
Yes, I used ZBrush and baked the normal map with xNormal.
This model is great, love the detail. 

Is it actually available to download anywhere? There are so many models that aren't free to download, but I don't know if they're just not available at al. (I'm new to Sketchfab, so I'm not sure how the system here works)

Out of curiosity did you actually use sculptgl for this and if so did you use several shapes or did you just build off of one? Asking to learn.

I LOVE this so so much!!
Beautiful work, man! And just 12k faces!? WOW!
@Marcio_Aureliano thanks, and yeah, since I come from an animation background I always strive to build the most optimized topology from the start, since you can always smooth and crease after the fact for renders or whatever, but that solid base makes it so much easier to rig and animate
Amazing work. Following you :)
Great work. I'm going to give this a staff pick
Thanks for the staffpick Bart! And also I managed to sort out the leg animation, I just had to pre-bake all animation onto ALL of the joints before exporting using Edit>Keys>Bake Simulation.  The first time I did that I failed to notice that the default option only bakes the selected joints, not the whole skeleton.  Demon's always in the details.
Hahaha these guys are great!
Haha those are great! :D Love the characteristic animations of each of those <3
Love these! So much personality in the designs and walks!
Amazing work!
Such an awesome team. Great job!
This is so good. Love their personalities.
LOOL I love this!
ugh, I want to Make something Like this. Awesome work man!

Saw the carefree stride of the blue croc, instant like. Love these!
You have really captured their personalities in their walk cycles!
I love the personality of each walking cycle, great work!
nice job! luv the alligator
Awesome
I love this more than I love whiskey.  ....and I love me some whiskey!  That alligator makes my heart smile so much :D
hahah really cool : D
ahhh i love this man!
What an amazing set! This is sooo good dude, you've brought them to life beautifully!

Hi! It looks so real. Is it ok to use your model in OSM 3D renders?
https://twitter.com/osm__go/status/965682090837725189
@-karlos- You can do anything with this. Of course, not overstepping the copyright of the BBC itself on a larger scale.
null
null
A new-by question: What scale are the models in Sketchfab? Shouldn’t it be shown in the Model Inspector?
About our Tardis: The largest vertice value is 124.0 - of what? Certainly not Millimeter. May be 2mm? 2.48 Meer could be the maximal Height of the top light. So the scale is 1:50
As my OSMgo.org uses 1 per Meter, it has to be scaled down by 1/50 and the metadata in the OSM 3D-Model Repository” is now corrected to 0.02
osmgo.org/go.html?lat=51.49201790&lon=-0.19281071&ele=1.50&dir=53&view=7&opt=0&name=TarDiS&con=1

Intake filter right behind the wheels?? Really?? :-D

@shaeen I know that this is a really bad Idea! But that's how they show it in the Trailer. Behind the wheels AND near the exhaust system - it's definitely the worst place for an intake filter.

Fucking incredible lad, would love to experiment animating this

the front end (in the orginal model) probably look like a 512,NSX, or even a 1987 Supra.

how to download your 3D model

Hey there @scottbreton! This is such a fantastic resource, the pose really helps understand how the muscles are working together ? 
Is there any possibility to purchase this model? I was hoping of using it as part of our training, I would make sure to cite yourself ofcourse ?
Hey Scott, this model looks fantastic. I'm a student specializing in rigging and I would like to practise skinning muscles to learn more about anatomy. Is there any way I could download this model? It's only for educational purpose.

A little bit confusing that there's another model with same name from  jwhammer.
Only differnence is the capital 'H' in Hut

How many UV ?
ah its runnning 4 uv,s. Legs, Arms, Torso, Backpack.. each 2k
Reinhardt body :D
haha yea, reinterpreted from the original body shape, but i kept the cool pieces similar.
The chest piece reminds me of Reinhardt from Overwatch.
Hey great piece when you imported did it have a inner piece there are huge holes at the top near the neck?
Just made it double sided, so removes the issue :)
@joshuawatt811 Awesome love your work!
Are all major parts (between each rotating joint) separate ?   Can this model be exported to .obj or another format ?
@k2msmith This model is designed in separate components for easy use. It comes as an fbx file but it should be easy to export out to an obj from it.
I purchased this model and the geometry and walk cycle animation imports into Maya but it can't seem to find the textures. Are the textures supposed to be in separate files (as they are delivered)  or embedded in the FBX file  ?  How do I tell maya where to find the textures ?  I put the texture .png files everywhere but it can't seem to find them.
@k2msmith Hey, the textures break when moving around new directories, you just need to plug them back into the shaders from the texture folder that will have come with the model.
This is awesome work.
what do you think he'll do if he found a tiny city? o:

@nebulousflynn Thank you for the pick Thomas! 

I must say this ended up better looking than I first expected! The trick here was to use the base roughness and a relatively high IOR (1.48) for the amber material.

@fciuffolini ;D
Refraction is possible in real-time here?!
@dante6686 Seems like it is ( check that blog entry: https://blog.sketchfab.com/sketchfab-now-supports-refraction/ )!
You can find it in the material tab of the 3D settings, under Opacity -> Refraction. And it is quite a playful feature I must say!
@norgeotloic That's awesome ;D thanks for the link
John Hammond: We spared no expense.
nice :) You can totally recreate the jurassic parc cane 

https://odditymall.com/jurassic-park-mosquito-in-amber-cane-replica
@beauvais.remi My turn:
Ian Malcom: That is one big pile of sh*t ;D
@lex1 Thanks!

Good idea with the cane! 
Actually i would like to recreate the scene of the description's picture (with lowpoly/flat-shaded/plain-white characters and a nice baking of the lights to recreate the scene's atmosphere), but I'm not that good for modeling or rigging persons (and a little lazy too)... 

BTW, if anyone wants to remix or integrate the model (or similarly inspired) in a scene, I'd love to see some re-uses !
Oh boy! Gonna clone some dinosaurs!
@seafoam To keep on quoting:
Ian Malcom: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.
Oh my god, this is amazing! I know nothing about 3D modeling or Photoshop, but this has to have been difficult.
@VoidedGolem Thanks!

It looks more difficult than it actually was:
No Photoshop was involved, and the modeling on this model is close to zero (as I got the mosquito from another model on Sketchfab). The only hard part was messing around with parameters for materials in a 3D software (blender, free and OpenSource!), but you get used to it...
Excellent job? I've made one amber model a few months ago and it was really a hard work. This model looks so real and breathtaking.

Awesome!
Is there any sort of color grading in the post process stack ? I can clearly see there's DOF, some form of AO, vignetting, but there's also a subtle change in color I can't quite make out
Does the purchased product come assembled as shown in the preview or is just all the pieces that can be put together to form the whole Haunted Mansion shown? I would be using this in another software package other than Unity.

awesome!
Fantastic, that's a staff pick!
Her face looks like a Akira Toriyama character, then I saw you other models and they where chrono trigger and dbz, now I know why :D
@bartv Thank you! :)
@nightflarer ??????????:)
There are a few sketchfab users that always blow my mind with their models. You are part of them! Great job as usual :)
@tiagojdferreira Thank you so much :)
This is mind-blowing! Fantastic work!
I've featured you on BlenderNation today! Enjoy :)

Wow! I really enjoyed this book series.
3d newb here: how did you get that outline effect that seems to be a color hold based on the color of the material? Just a fancy shader?
@bartv Thank you sooo much!
@natedsaint I use the inverted normal method for outline. And I prepared a simple texture that painted black and brown for outline. I put UV on the black color for general outline, and put hair UV on brown color.

Sorry for my bad english.

If you can't understand, this article will help you.

@JunSkywa1ker Your english is infinitely better than my Japanese, so no worries =D. I'll definitely check out that blog. Thanks so much!
Nice panties XD
Btw, the hair looks a little dumb, but the rest of it is awesome!
como lo descargo?
This is like actual 2d anime art brought to 3D life... it is not emulating it. .. it IS it.
Does this react to light as the same way 2d is painted?
??????(•'?'• ?)?
Nicely done! Do you have any tutorials for sale? I'm interested in understanding the workflow of taking the hand-drawn 2d style into the 3d space using Blender. I'm really inspired by what you've done. Keep up the good work!
wish i can download this for my self learning. :D

Thanks again!
@foxdie491 You may use it.
Nice work :) Used it to show my nephew how to mix drone footage with Blender magic!
@oroborosnz Thank you! Glad you had use of it :)
Amazing creation. Are you good at creating your own spaceship designs and interiors???  Also, would you mind if I use this for a few projects? One being a mock animated logo for a costuming group-not sure if would get used yet.
@kanndkat Thank you! I haven't really tried to do a design of my own. I started a few times, but never got into it. Same with interiors. You can use my models in any way you want, but remember that Disney has the copyright on Star Wars.
@DanielAndersson Cheers for that.  Ah that's a shame. I'm trying to find people who might be able to help with a sci-fi short film for festivals. Keep up the good work though.  And yes, Disney do hold all rights...the vid's just for a Pro Costuming group for charity so we don't make money from it all. There are tons all over the world and wear not just Star Wars costumes but all types. But we attend events and thought it would be nice to do an animated video for our new logo. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnNrMFVaXiY
@kanndkat Glad to see the models getting used and especially glad since it's for a worthy cause :) What short film is it you're planning to do?
@DanielAndersson I have a sci-fi short film I am writing but have a load of CGI bits need for it. It's sort of a pilot for hopefully turning into a couple of feature films with some form of financial backing (if the short is done well enough and can get funding as the short won't be).  I'm teaching myself sculpting in blender so I can create a couple of animal creations. Creating a new universe of sort - trying to avoid a lot of Star Wars inspiration but you really can't avoid it completely. lol

@CemBoi Adding greebles (details) are fun but also takes a while. It's not difficult but it all depends on how much time and effort you want to put into a model and what it should be used for. This is like the 4th version or something of the TIE. I add details, then take a break, then add more and so on. Also building a library with greebles and then copy them onto the model also works in a lot of cases.
The model is beautiful ^_^ But I wonder if the original format zip does not miss the texture file ?
@gizmhail Thanks! I think it's because I've used linked materials when I made it and Sketchfab can't handle that. There is however no texture in this, just basic colors so it's easy to fix. Thanks for telling me.
Oh, sorry for my mistake then. I opened a lot of your (incredibly gorgeous ? ) models yesterday, and since they all had a texture folder, I though there was something missing here.
Again, thanks for sharing these great pieces of art ? !
@gizmhail Not easy to know! I'm not good at texturing and have never liked any of my scratched metal materials, so when I redid that I just went with a basic grey and skipped using textures. I quickly upload a new version with no linked materials. Hope that works :)

Is it reconstructed from google maps data?
@alban Hi Alban, yes done wirh google datas.
Impressive, especially as you derived this from publicly available data ? Do you have a description of how this process works?

I'm staff picking it!
@bartv Thank you Bart for staff pick. On this study case, we exploited the 3D model published on google earth to export images that we use to reconstruct the model (by photogrammetry). In the end, this allows to generate a new 3D model usable on sketchfab (especially for VR).
@dronesimaging did you automate that in any way, or did you take screenshots of the app?
@bartv No automation. We take screenshots manually of the app.
Thanks!

Nice... but not a Blue Whale. Looks almost like a Humpback from the short body and huge pectoral fins. Five stars for modeling and texturing, but you lose one for misidentifying the species. ;)

I'm Staff Picking it.

How many photos/cameras did you use?
By the way, for performance reasons, we will never display the 8000x8000 texture because it's not power of 2. If you want a texture that big, you should bump it up to 8192x8192.

That said, I think the 4096x4096 texture displayed here is very good and performs much better.
Thank you James for the texture tip! It's good to know.

The capture has over 1400 raw photos. The final model was made out of 800 15 Mpx photos. The result was a 11 million polygon mesh which was optimized to a 94k polgyon mesh.
¡¡¡¡Bombazo!!!
Very impressive indeed ! Not a single flaw even in the corners and overhang. Great textures. 
Fantastic scan !

AND it's a very nice church too, this unusual architecture is beautiful
Superb scan, and the retopology work is really nice and clean too. 
May I ask how you did the clean-up work ? All manually ?
Hi @gerpho, Thank you for your comment. It means a lot coming from you. 

A great church like this one deserves a great 3D model, right?

I'm specially proud of the inner part of the tower, although its not the most engaging part, but since all the photos have been taken from the outside...

What do you think of the closing 3D wall? Do you like it as it is or would you have left the open mesh visible?
Hi @kiwimage,

Appreciate your comment, specially the retopology part.

This result was made possible by subdividing the retopologized mesh.
Beautiful! What photogrammetry software do you use? Did you do the subdivision in the application, or another modeling package? Thanks.
Fully agreed : great church, great scan !
I had noticed the inside of the tower from the begining, and the challenge it must have been. I agree it's not the most impressive part, except for those, like myself, who have already tried  unsuccesfully to do the same thing :)
Regarding the closing wall : It' depends on the subject : in this case it helps to reinforce the impression of hilltop location of the church, but it may also draw attention from the real subject, and give an artificial look to the scene. It's really a question of oppinion.
Hi @topofsteel!

Thank you! I used @agisoft Photoscan. It's not only affordable but powerfull and mostly reliable for any kind of project.

The post-processing was made mostly in Blender, but there are also some touches of photoshop involved.
Yes @gerpho the inside was quite a challenge. Thank you, I knew you would notice it ;)

And... good point. It gives and artificial look to it. I kind of like it that way, but I know it draws the attention from the model itself. I'll be updating it to test some possibilities. I'll keep you updated here.
Thanks for your answer Néstor, I'll give it a try in my spare time, your results are motivational.
Excelente modelo. Falta decir dónde está esta iglesia...
Efectivamente, @bajaltura.com gracias por el apunte. Ya está solucionado.

Muchas gracias por la felicitación.

Un saludo.
*wow ,1400 photos! If I run so many photos(up 200) in agi,my computer would definitely crash or run very very slowly.Could you please teach me what to configure or escalate my computer hardware if I want agisoft run faster and better?
My computer spec: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz  3.4 GHz
                               (RAM): 16.0 GB
What can I do?
Thank you.
Hi @xiezhong this model was made on a i7 CPU @ 4 GHz; 32 GB RAM. But i7 and 16 GB of RAM is more than enough to make models from 100-200 photos.

This model took several hours to process and and even more to optimize for web display. It can be frustrating to have your computer processing for so long, but the results are usually better.

So... you have a good machine, be patient, let it work ;)
Excellent work! Did you do the retopology manually or automatically? I performed some tests with the auto-retopology tool [Instant Meshes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6wtw6W4x3I) on photogrammetric models, but the results so far are not very different from just standard decimation.
Thank you @rdfcabral 

I didn't know about that tool. Thanks! I'll give it a try; but in my experience, automatic retopology is not so good so far in photogrammetric models...  I bet you arrived to the same conclusion. But I'll get better, for sure.
Impresionante trabajo, muy buena calidad de la imagen.
Me gustaría saber de cuantas fotografías se compone, estoy detrás de hacer algo parecido con un antiguo convento que hay en mi pueblo.
Gracias por compartirlo.
Hola @eugeniochg, muchas gracias por valorar el modelo.

La captura en bruto tiene cerca de 1400 fotografías. El modelo final empleó unas 800. El resultado fue una nube de 400 millones de puntos y una malla de 11 millones de polígonos.

Veo que eres de Sebulcor, ¿te refieres al convento de la Hoz? Sería espectacular verlo en 3D (aunque hay que reconocer que es todavía más impresionante estar allí en persona). Te dejo mi correo por si quieres comentar algún detalle más: nestor.marques@me.com
Hola de nuevo.
Ayer te mandé un mail, pero se me fue el dedo y te lo envié sin asunto.
Descuida @eugeniochg, ahora le echo un vistazo!
Que gran trabajo. Me parece un modelo excelente y muy bien terminado. Felicidades y gracias por compartirlo. Yo estoy empezando en este mundo. Que software usas para añadir la peana?
Un saludo

@derehe Mostly Blender. I also used Krita for texture work.
@JunSkywa1ker wow, thank you bro, i 've never heard Krita before, it 's really cool though
Beautiful.

Very cool. Runs to fast on my computer. Wish it could slow down.

Very clever concept. I will steal it as all great artists do.#haha

Congratulation @R0m1R - this awesome scan has won this month's 3D Scanning Challenge!
https://blog.sketchfab.com/sketchfab-3d-scanning-challenge-food/

A member of the team will be in touch soon to arrange getting your prize to you :)
Congrats! Delicious entry! ?
Very creative work, well done!
this is amazing on so many levels!
love this
Thank you everyone !

@the_fly for the animation, I've used this tutorial :https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/203058018-Animations#timeframe

@SFMike normally you could select a different spped in the left bottom corner of the sketcfab viewer

@airibreathe for the backside, It would need to have a different kind of camera rig. 

@nebulousflynn It's an honor ;)
@R0m1R Thanx
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

Fabulous, gets my staff pick.
ps: could be nice to add sound!
@alban Thank you very much for the staffpick!!! 
Unfortunately as much as I would like to have sound, I 've already tried adding a snake hissing noises but the problems is, the animation loops every 2,5 secs, so the noises repeat way too often, and it becomes really annoying, really fast.
Amazing stuff :)
oh wow I  love this. Can i use it on my website?

PS: one small suggestion: I see you used the camera limits feature - it might be a good idea to limit the amount of zoom too?
Hey @bartv, really tks!!

i'll try it!!
@flaviomarialva much better now :-) ?
Great scan for 48 shots ...well done and congrats on staff pick ..... 

I must confess I am not a huge fan of these camera limitations as it seems to work against the whole point of exploration in 3D ... I find it quite frustrating ... I have seen it used on other 3D models and personally can't see why this feature has been added?
Great model, i would love to 3d-print her...
@paul3uk Agreed, limitations don't make sense. You can't even see the whole model at the current limits.
This is black for me.
Hi. 

Great model.
What software did you use to stitch the images?
Thx @robertitoss1, i used Agisoft Photoscan tryout version, it's really good!!!

@Astrum ikr
it feels kind of pointless if you can't download or do anything with it.

It is just like a 360 image and nothing more

@grizeldi Thanks! Check this one out by the original artist. ! https://sketchfab.com/models/027435a961e44df0ac19cc13f10872c0
Hey just curious about what your pipeline for this model was, if you dont mind sharing :)
@wolvski Sure! I used Blender for most of the process. Modelled just using standard poly modelling workflow. Extruding faces and pulling verts. Painted with soft brush and gradient tool. I used 'mask by selected polys' quite a lot. You can see on top of his shoulders where I have selected the top faces and applied a gradient then blended with blur tool. I did the eyes and the cape pattern in photoshop. In the scene, I had one version of the model fully assembled and another version exploded (all separate parts) next to it. This way I can paint in all the hard to reach places and still see the assembled version in real time as they share the same texture and material. Hope this helps. :)

Thank you very much. It looks awesome. Congrats :D

By the way, which software did you use to create this?
really nice
Great baking
Thank you very much for your concern :) All your comment would be really appreciated and we'll try to upload more ;)
Hello Bart, sorry for the late response of your question and thank you very much for positive comment. We're producing more than 150 floorplans daily for Nordic and UK clients and this is one of them. The software were used is variety such as Roomsketcher (a Norwegian online solution), Sketchup, 3DSMax, Baking  include GIMP and Adobe suite as well as our own custom programmed scripts and libraries. 
For your interest, here we used Baking for the lighting:) Please don't hesitate to give us any question and we'll answer it as soon as possible :)
Wow that's an impressive number! How many people work in your team? And how did you like using Sketchfab with this model? I'd love to see more like it ;-)
Dear Barth we are 70 + persons in our 3 companies in Thailand and Vietnam but just a part working with 3D floorplans and real estate photo editing. The other focus areas for us is: Civil Engineering/BIM modeling, 3D project movies and Web programing. Please as well see: www.baezeni.com for more details. And yes, we'd love to share more like this too :)
Impressive! I'd like to have a more private conversation with you, could you contact me using the 'Contact' link on my profile page? Thanks!
I love the look of the glass! What program/s did you make this on? Ps. I would definitely live here, so cool!
@anniew yeah me too! Although I'm not sure about those dining room chairs... :P (detailed software info in older comments, by the way).

@Baezeni your models are very impressive, and your workflow sounds intense! One small detail: it looks like you've got an overlapping / flickering surface inside the washing machine.
@anniew Thank you very much for your positive comment. We use variety software to produce our products, FYI here we use 3DSMax and Baking for the lighting :)
@PadreZippo Your comment are really valuable to us and you have really sharp eyes btw ;) We'll take it into account and try to develop our model in the future, hope that we can hear more from you :D
Congrats we selected your model for this article in ArchDaily: http://www.archdaily.com/782972/7-examples-of-how-to-show-off-interiors-in-your-3d-models-as-selected-by-sketchfab

I really, really love it!! where did you get the data for the thorax for example?
this is amazing!
Thanks! 
Mieke, I just use a lot of reference images, videos, photos and diagrams. But there are a lot of guessing in modeling anyway.
I can imagine. Working again on my Maybug right now and although I have a specimen myself right now, I still have problems interpreting all the anatomy of the thorax. The literature is on it is sparse and of low quality.
incredible,

The level of details is too good to be true.
Would love to play a game as an insect, lol.
Amazing model!
This is so nice! Have you tried the C4D exporter plugin? https://sketchfab.com/exporters/cinema4d

Just 30k poly, OMG!
I must admit - this quality of geometry/poly count is mad.
CLOUD I DOWN THESE FOR A SCHOOL WORK?
Great model,
I think you could uncheck the TAA on transparent pixels in the tab post process, it would remove the buggy pixels effect on the background logo.
Is there any way to download those models?
@cedric Thanks! Updated.

@snapp @SHENGJIAJIE These models are not available for download, sorry.
Awesome work, you're raising the bar for the industry with these models.

Quick question, did all the polys make it to PUBG or did you make a lower poly version for production?
@StarkRavingSane Hi! Thank you for the kind words, I really appreciate :)

This is the actual model seen in the game.
Magnifique modèle !  J'adore la tache d'huile ;-)

@Ichentogo You should be able to since it looks like a rip from a video game. I don't think he made this. Quite a few of his other models are video game rips so he doesn't own the rights to them.

It doesn't look like a ripp off from a game and if you accuse people do it with some proof

amazing models, there is a lot to learn from you, such a shame that your free tutorial can not be accessed in my region!

Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

Thank you sir, it's much appreciated!
this is pretty dope (but the knees are odd) I think that's supposed to be muscle tissue over the knee that fades into the tibia, but it's textured to match the bones. My guess is it was just an oversight cause the rest looks great.
Thanks for the feedback, I've updated some of the issues that I've noticed since posting it.
We suggested your work to It's Art Magazine for their weekly picks and they included it! Enjoy :)

How I can buy this model ? Amazing work...
I have been studying anatomy for a while, this model was really helpful until I found that from the elbow to the deltoid, the anatomy is incorrect. Source: a friend who is a doctor and this image that made me doubt about this model   https://mavidano.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/muscular_system_back.jpg?w=920
Thank you
Great work ....

Hello, are you available for freelance work, I love this and have a client who may need similar work.

If so please contact me at ziggy@getaugmently.com Excellent work, you are a great talent!
please put this model up for sale or download, I want I want I want
@directorfmmg okay it is done. I will also upload the decimated and cut high poly version, ready for printing, and will show how the printed figure will look, because it is already done. I just have to pick it up tomorrow.
ha, this is great! love those teeth!
I love this so much. Nice work! :D
Looks great! Is it possible to 3d-print this item? Or will the STL file later be added?
@xlcreations No, this is only low poly version. It is not possible to be printed and to look good:). It will look like a low poly. Could be interesting, but i don't recommend.
I will add link to the high poly ready for print model when i am sure it could be printed and it will look good. Maybe in the next 7-10 days.
Print ready version is uploaded here https://skfb.ly/6zZAO

In the render it looks a little smooth, and in the image that you made printed you can see more details.
The 3D model for printing comes detailed.

How many pics/shots for this one??? its really amazing full 3d :)
@panomedia Thanks! As you can see from the description, this was made with a structure sensor + the itseez3D app, so the capture happens in real-time and it's not photogrammetry.
Awesome!
this is incredible...

This is absolutely fantastic in design and color scheme, The only thing that bugs me is that inklings have only 6 hair tentacles, and their arms and legs bring the count up to an even and accurate 10.

How did you do that the pupils are moving inertionally? 

You see the effect when the animation is paused, you zoom on the eye and move the model carefully from left to right and vice versa.

I work at Sketchfab and am looking into support for Volumetric content like CT scans (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering). Do you have sample files by any chance? That could help us.

Corentin
@corentin Sorry, I dont have any CT Scan data with me... I made this model by sheer approximation and some references.... This is a hand made one, so sorry, I dont have any such data...
@docjana here are some tips on improving the behaviour of transparent objects:

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/202602073-Transparency
@bartv Thanks, I needed it..
Oh, quick fix: split the internals into smaller objects. One large joined object makes it hard for us to sort the faces properly.
@bartv, do you want me to divide the internal organs into various parts before uploading?
Yes, that would probably solve the flickering that you see now.
@bartv, thanks, I will when I can...
@docjana ok no worries, thanks :)
Can you please tell me what softwares you used to make this incredible model? 
Thanks!
I used zbrush and cinema 4d....
Bellissimo.

Grazie!
the link provided to get the model are not working. where can we get the model?
As below, is there still a way of downloading the model? Would be much appreciated, thanks!
WOW, amazing!

Thanks :) It was originaly made to be an animation sequence, so it's great to hear :)
Hello Yann, I was wondering how you made the gradient in the background? 
Hi Laurenstjong,
It's a Sketchfab Pro feature. You can upload any image as background.
Ah yes that is a great feature... at the moment I am faking it using a colored sphere :D
Absolutely awesome! Great work!
This is incredibly cool, good job!
Very Nice.
Love how dynamic this looks and so much energy it has. Excellent work
@Kokusho nice work ,how did u managed to create custom skybox

How fun! Not too bad. It reminds me of an old FS2002 Model aircraft or todays mobile versons. Then out comes FSX Captain Sims AC-130 which blows everyone's mind with the detail. Nice detail on the exterior textures here.
@allstarmagnetics thx
Great model!  If you don't mind I am doing a tutorial series on how to make Battle Royale mechanics and I'd like to use this as an example plane model.  Full credit in the description and a link to (this page and) your portfolio.  Thanks very much!
Here is a link to the first video so that you can see what we have so far:

@mentallic3d Hi mentallic3d. Fantastic. You can of course. My english is so poor, but I likke your project :) My model is your.

use substance painter
@sirenko ?
Substance Painter - is not dificult programm for PBR Texturing your model in 3D , or 2D (like u wont), in painting and low randering in realtime. 
PBR - Physically based rendering ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering )
Today it is a Base...
@sirenko Does it work under GNU/Linux? If so then it has an interest, if not then directly to the trash can

I create games with unity. I would like to add this plane to my game. I would like to credit you by putting an image that says
Helijah from Sketchfab on the pre-game screen (the pre-game screen is the screen where it shows made with Unity and the logos of the developers.) may I do that?

(Basically, may I credit you on the pre-game screen?
@sungodjelly Hello. Of course you can? I would be honored and flattered. Don't forget to send me some pictures of the game at embaranger@gmail.com. Thank you.

any chance for an aloy model?

@hsnsnh165 Hey, sorry for the late answer but I've just seen this. Yes you can do what you want with it as long as I'm credited ;). Have fun putting this model in a game though. It's not really optimised for this ^^.
this is some high quality shit right here. i used it toghether with a selfmade aloy model in a clip for vfx school assignment and it doesnt look bad at all
@Gloomeskk   im trying to place the file in blender it not working andim trying ot make it into a obj so I could place it in maya and 3d print it its a awesome model
@Night_Mare witch file did you download
so amazing , i adore you!
OMG!
@MovieFactoryYT @hellolirui Thank you ! ? 
@Night_Mare I assume you found a solution in 4 months but in case you didn't, the print ready models are available on Thingiverse.
pfv vc consegue fazer um modelo da Aloy ??? seus modelos são incriveis eu sou do brasil kkk
@rs576601 Thanks ! Actually, I'm thinking about making a model of Aloy soon. Not sure but maybe ?
Amazing! Can it be used freely for anything? In what program did you make this? I just started out with iClone and Blender, total noob hoping to learn from anyone:-) Take care all the best Albin

Thank you TAK_Bomb, texture is quite low, in fact, you can say there is no texture at all, just a low res autoUV for ambient occlusion
I love this, Great work.
Please sell this on the Unity asset store. :)
Why sell if i can give it fir free :)
beautiful ! thank you for share !
I downloaded your model to do a 3d print. Thank you.

That's great, thou i thought it's not print ready, could you send a picture of what came out?
Thank you!. It was satisfied that the free model. Great job!
Wow this robot is really stunning. Really love the metal too. Sketchfab website often enhance 3D meshes. Their WebGL engine is some serious coding.

This piece is sooo cool. great work.

This model looks fantastic.  I'm learning by doing, and so making a sci fi movie is a great way to learn.  This model looks like it can play the part of a security guard overseeing slave humans.  I'm looking forward to testing it out.  Thank you.

Are you going to find out how to turn ON the lights in Sketchfab someday ???? Your models look excellent but they can barely be seen. How can you spend so much time sculpting great models and spend so little time enhancing the way they look ?
Ughhh... nighmare fuel.  Something went wrong. :D

Check out your model, or maybe it's problem with browser/sketchfab 
anyway it's terryfying.

Nice.  I created the something similar in Maya as a class assignment.
@KangaroOz-3D nice, would be great to have an animated version of it.
If I can use this model of yours, I can create an animated model in Blender.  Then I will put it on Youtube.com and give you the URL of the animation.

I am working on it and I will add more details as moons of Mars turning around the planet. I hope to finish it for next week
Nice job, KangaroOz 3D,

I assume you are aware that your 'Solar System' made it into the experimental Volupedia (Wikipedia w/ 3D content from Sketchfab). For those interested, it can be found at http://en.volupedia.org/wiki/Solar_System. And, there's a blog about the experiment at http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/134395696834/introducing-volupedia-wikipedia-powered-by?utm_source=weekly-digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly-digest-2015-12-08.

P.S. For scientific accuracy, check your annotation #7:
Kepler belt
The large belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter

You may be confusing things with the 'Kuiper belt' (ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt), which is interesting in its own right, but not part of the inner Solar System. Actually, you might want to add this feature, especially considering it's part of the reason Pluto is now classified as a 'dwarf planet'.
CORRECTED LINK:

Solar System on Volupedia

http://en.volupedia.org/wiki/Solar_System
CORRECTED LINK:

Drats, missed one letter in 'Kuiper belt' on Wikipedia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt
Hi swami, 

Thanks a lot for your correction about the Kuiper belt, I have just done it. Thanks too to share on the wikipedia page my 3D solar System. I will work on some 3D models of all planets to integrate on others pages for each planet.
You're welcome, KOz3D. You may also want to include somewhere a NOT TO SCALE comment (perhaps as 3D text, or in an annotation) - include it in addition to the 'ABOUT THIS MODEL' section, which is not seen by everybody. This scale issue will be obvious to many, but lots of newbies will not know.

OK, keep up the great work. SCIENCE! :D
I checked your annotation #7. I NEED TO CLARIFY: the asteroid belt is NOT the Kuiper belt. They are two different things. Check Wikipedia for details, but basically, the Kuiper belt (pronounced, KAI-pur, where AI is like eye) is a large collection of Sun-orbiting stuff, including Pluto, and beyond - so, much farther out than the asteroid belt. FYI, even farther out (WAY farther) is the hypothesized Oort Cloud. Again, Wikipedia:)

Realy like your work. Its any chance for some tutorial or timelapse from texturing workflow?
Awesome models!
I'm currently working on a car and I was wondering, how did you create the glass for this car? I've been trying multiple things but none of those gave me the good results you have.
@Jamey98 

A decent tip for glass is to make it slightly more opaque around the edges. Really makes it pop.
Marvelous work man! :)
Sweet!
Nice.  Looks great.  I can see that some work went in on you model.
Stunning!
Nice job. I like it.

Great 3D model.
reat job! Thank you!
Simplesmente, adorei! Obrigado amigo! Abraços!
Você conseguiria me dar um curso tipo rápido?
Hoje eu trabalho com 3ds max, mas não vejo a hora de mudar de software!
@toninhorosa Ola, tbm utiliso 3ds Max e nao vejo uma grande diferenca deste software em relacao a outros, para modeling. No caso da animacao, concordo que o Maya eh melhor, por oferecer um workflow bem mais eficaz e rapido.
Se vc sente uma necessidade de fazer um upgrade, te aconselho fazer um tour aprofundado em Pixologic Zbrush e metodo de texturizacao PBR.
Obrigado por teu comentario
How long did it take? Did you model every polygon by hand? Is there a quicker way?
I was just thinking of Herbie a day or two ago. I searched the web for Herbie 3d models but came up blank. But now I browse Sketchfab for the first time and BANG, there it is! Awesome.
Classic!
thank you, so much. great work

@MatthijsDeRijk Norse Mythology is indeed part of Cultural Heritage & History - if describing a mythological event is part of your intention with this scene I would ask you to add some description of what story this scene is based on to give it historical context.

this isn't art this is a master peace
So uh... I make melee weapon mods for a VR game called Robo Recall... this is totally gonna be a new weapon. OoO That's incredible! Amazing work! thanks for letting us download it!
Oh, also, I'm having just a little trouble with the textures. I can get the colors to show up right everywhere except the green on the hilt in UE4. Not sure why.
@firestorm185 The green in the hilt is the only part that is not metallic, it may have to do with that. UE4 uses a metallic workflow (which requires base color, roughness and metal textures). If those were not included in this release, please download the model from https://gamebanana.com/models/3960 to find them attached, and after importing the roughness disable its sRGB checkbox. That should give you more accurate results in UE4 projects. Thanks for using the model! :)
@yogensia Oh, ok, that makes more sense! It worked pretty well in Unreal already, the glossiness looked pretty spot on, that green was the only part that was giving me trouble, but yeah, I'll check out the other release and see if that helps! here's the link to the mod page - https://bit.ly/2klTisx
@yogensia And it worked! Yeah, was missing those textures, downloaded the other one and they worked like a charm! Thanks again for such an amazing model, Yogensia! ^^

The Grafiks are pretty good, but I don'treally like the lenght and the movement of his neck. Except for that it's just wonderful, keep going
Constructive criticism: Needs some more animation on the walk - particularly there's no evidence of weight shifting to each leg as the creature bears down on it. Also the leg movement is pretty mechanical. But it's off to a promising start!
Thank you for the critiques @paulchambers3d and @Lomotho. :) I'll affine my animation according to your remarks and I'll re-upload it as soon as I enhance it. ^^)

Thanks @iggy-design ! :)
@paulchambers3d I've entirely remade the walk cycle animation according to your criticisms. I've weighed and added more animation to his steps. I've also add a head movement and made its gestures less mechanical making it more alive. :)
Wow! So much better. I hope everyone else will agree. Much more natural, fluid and more shifting in the shoulders. Deserves a Staff Pick!
Thank you @paulchambers3d !! :D
I usually like all your models, but this one is definitely dope! 
Awesome work @kyan0s !
this is a good dinosaur. A little mushy skin weights around the hips, but hardly noticeable without the wireframe one. 9/10
Thank you @waleguene, it's motivating ! :D

Thanks @jtp360 ! :)
Awesome! :D
Thanks @BoloPL !
Woah, awesome. The animation and presentation is great,
Thank you @Johnson-Martin ! :D
Awesome work, the animation is great
Thanks @shamar ! :)
really good, I would like to know how long did it take aproximately, to do each step(modeling/sculpting, texturing, animation..) ?
Thanks @Archeopteryxfr  ! :)

Well, of course it depends of the complexity of the creature, but in this case, for a ceratopsian, the modeling of the base takes me about ten to fifteen hours, to which I add about five or six hours of sculpture (wrinkles, scales, bump of the skin, etc.). But I've earlier modeled a Triceratops (https://skfb.ly/NxuP) so I've already had a good part of my base. I've especially remade the head and made some modifications to the body.
The rigging about three hours. The duration of texturing is very relative, about four hours maybe. And the animation is also relative but for this styracosaurus, about ten hours.

Voilà ! :)
do you have a tutorial of this? :D
Greaaaaat
@jigijigi.bambam No I do not have a tutorial, but it's an idea, I could make one if I find time. ^^)

Thanks @binghareeb2 !
wow! I wish I could see a video of this rigging

Hi ! 
I would like to ask you some question about how you uploaded this model from blender.
I love too make some low poly/isometric art, but I have some issue to upload on sketchfab because, when I upload the models, I can't see my shaders on the model and I have to bake the material on the model. 
Do I have to bake the shaders and upload the textures to see my colours? there is no other way?

@Jettrail yes, but only if the mod will be published on STEAM. Also, you give me a link to the mod page, embed the sketchfab viewport with this model on the mod page and specify in the text of the description that I am the author of 3D model.
AWESOME, it looks like the HBRA3 in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
there is no bolt  so we cant animate for game
Looks great! What type of weapon is it? I wasn't sure if those were supposed to like 8 barrels at the from or is this some kind of energy weapon?
@Rone1, incorrect question. This is not a realistic weapon, and it will shoot whatever you want - taser projectile, plasmoids or thunder/fire-ball.
It's so cool. I love it!!!!!

Wow
over all well done, but her eye balls seem to be misplaced. The shadow of the upper right eye lid is way too large.
Very good sweet model!!!

Could you put thsi model for Download? Cause it would be pretty awesome if it was printed by a 3D Printer
love, please can i get the obj file  ?
Wow this is so amazing and cool! :)
I was just wondering, how long did this take?
Hey! I'm making a game with unity3d, could you possibly want to put this character on unity3d's asset store for sale or sell it directly?
@diablo1 Sorry, that's Riot games property :)
@kashu This took like 3-4 weeks to make :)

@bartv done, do I get staff pick? =3
We'll see ? How this works is that we share work internally and then vote on it. You're in the process!
@bartv ic. Btw how does sketchfab compress image files? I'm on mobile displaying the model texture quality on low by default, and It looks very murky. I intentionally uploaded some jpeg textures for ease of loading but I'm guessing SF has its own built in compression that bumps that down
@deuschanz We do, especially on mobile devices. Your scene has a rather high number of large texture maps and some mobile devices will have trouble playing them. You can force-switch to HD textures by clicking on the gear icon in the viewer and selecting HD textures (it will say SD or even LD for you now).
@bartv can I have a breakdown on which ones are huge so that I can bump them down? I did a similar thing with my Filo model which had more content in it but didnt really get the muddy nerf. The purpose really is to ensure it works without having the users press on anything
@bartv nvm, I figured it out. Bumping the 2k textures down by 1800x1800 seems to do the trick without losing much quality
@deuschanz We recommend always using powers of two for your texture maps - so 1024x1024, 1024x2048, 2048x2048 etc.
I featured you on BlenderNation, have a great week!

How do you get such beautiful surface color in your scans? I am also scanning skulls as part of my research and I can get great scans of the surface topography, but in real color the shadows from the light hitting the object at many different angles end up overlapping to create a strangely blotchy real-color version. Any tips?
Hi @obionfire depends on what you are scanning with. If you're using Artec Spider, like we've used for this scan, then this kind of color is natural to its scans. The only two small tips to improve the color are to configure texture brightness slider before you will start recording, and to be sure not to move the scanner too close to the object.

Nice job. Is sketchfab supporting freestyle rendering exported from blender or what?
Thanks Pikachu o.O (weird thing to say uh?) 
dreadKnight, thanks... what do you mean? the black ink/toon style? Is just a duplicated and larger mesh with inverted normals xD
Yes, I meant the toon style. Thanks for sharing, will try it out as well as it seems it does the job pretty good and works everywhere basically :-)
This is awesome!
Oh my god, I really love this model! what program did you use??
Wow. It's almost like I was playing Smash Bros and hit pause!
Very interesting in this model is the black outline. 
I was looking all the time for a post effect in the player-settings till I finally found the trick with the inverted shell outside. 

Excellent work and technique!
I love it !! Congrats !! :D
download please
Hey, just wanted to let you know that this was featured on our social media! Congrats!
Woah this is so amazing and life like! :)

i love it please can i download and i need help to animate it
omg can i get this for my 3d print ?
I can tell this had alot of effort in this!
really cool poses, but why does it have so much crazy Polygons?
Beau travail ! Félicitations.

it was my first attempt to mimic Overwatch style and all I've done was gathering screenshots and look closely at their art ;)

You can also have a look at this excellent paper : https://80.lv/articles/overwatch-technical-overview/
@benlucas59 That's a great link, looks like I'll be able to learn a lot. Thanks!
Very clean, but full of character!
Well done. It deserves a staff pick.
Just wanted to let you know that 3dtotal loved this so much they featured it on their site:
https://www.3dtotal.com/index_news_detailed.php?id=17849&type=2#.WnhjkZM-eL4
Hey Paul Thx for the info ;)
You might consider removing the Rolling Stones logo due to copyright concerns. I'm not that familiar with Sketchfab's licensing but that trademark could possibly negate it for use in commercial work.

Regardless, this model is beautifully done.
@j-conrad you might be absolutely right, thx !
how do u round your edges?
Awesome work, inspired me to try make my own! =)
Beautiful work! I love it. But now I have to warn you, someone has made the (almost) same building as yours and he's selling it at a higher price. 
This is the copy https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tiny-house-79862e156b164b24bf5bf0620e951c94
I thought that at least, you should know about it.
Regards.
@johana.sg Thx for the information ;) This model is so ugly I don't fear the competition :p
A instalação eléctrica é mesmo á Tuga :)
@benlucas59 Hahaha no problem. But your model is great! I wish I could do things like this ? Keep it up!
bro you made this in blender
@Yankee64 Hi, 3Ds Max, ZBrush and Sustance Designer/Painter ;)
nice it's so sick man very beautiful

Hey Jonathan, I really admire your work on this Skeleton. Would you mind giving me some pointers on how to model one like this? And do you mind if I use yours as a reference? Thanks
Thanks OmnibladeZ.  No real secret to modelling it, except for Searching google images intensively and creatively for reference images!  and then lots of time spent in zbrush :)
OK to use the model as reference, but then you will be following any mistakes I have made!
Hey thanks for commenting back, do you mind sharing your scenes for this model? I'm fairly new to the modelling scene and learning with maya. Is this level of detail achievable with maya alone or do I need to learn on zbrush too? Thanks Jonathan
This is amazing! Is there a way to buy this model? I'm a vet student and it would be really awesome to print this for study!
Hello. Is it possible to buy the model?
man this look like a reeeal good work there!
This is amazing and really helpful as a reference :D Thanks so much for sharing!
This is incredible! This is probably gonna be one of my main references for articulating my cat's skeleton when she passes, it's a lovely pose!!

Hi, does it include t-pose and rigged?
@Dante.C Yes, Tifa model is t-posed and skinned in 3Ds Max.
And full model and materials setup but not rigged yet in Blender.
This is fantastic! I would love to be able to get this and put it in the original game! I'm a full-time modder for FF7 and this would be an incredible asset to put towards our others. I don't really have any spare cash for this but if i was to gather some would i have permission to put this inside the OG Game?
@Tsunamix Sure you can <3
awesome?thankyou for you share!!??:)
@RyanReos Fantastic! Thank you! The players will LOVE this when i manage to get it haha
@RyanReos Purchased the model over on CGTrader and my god it's fantastic, i seen you can be hired over there. How long does a model take roughly? My team is happy to pay this price again and again for each and every Main Character you do if you're up to the task
This is a really beautiful remake.
Are these rigged?
I Love this Tifa!! Can't wait anymore for the release of FFVIIR!! ?

this very nice model but when i open in 3ds max water texture is disable?
I changed some stuff in Sketchfab, so it might have to change some settings in Max.
Sea model texture (Cudillero Bake FinalWater) missing...  if you can please attach that...

asdkasdasf im speechless
@Zolaris :D
Holy crap that's good
I'm impressed, you even modelled Garnet's eyes
Very beautiful work! <3
Holy crap. Would you be interested in doin a steven universe game with me? XD
@SpiceyWolf I had the same idea I may not be as good as most people at coding cause I am still learning and lovely job ASideOfChidori
@RavenCarson Im dead serious about it, im putting some of chidoris models into a demo game right now and gunna be making some literal gameplay. (Still need to figure out what ima do about maps i am just garbage at modeling)
@asideofchidori What makes you determine which models to share the download for or not? I do 3d printing and modeling and my girlfriend is a huge SU fan. I want to model a few of the characters from SU but I am sooooo aweful and 3d modeling. I would sincerely love you forever if you would share a few of your files with me :0
@shoeless_jo Usually I like to release the models that I feel are finished, though if you want something early I can always send you anything you need that I have on me :)
@asideofchidori Omg no way :000000000000 Specifically the stronger than you scene is one that I wanted to recreate because that is the first scene we ever saw of steven universe. I real life replica of that scene would be adorable. It is what got me hooked. But I absolutely adore cool pearl as well <3 Your work is seriously so beautiful.
@shoeless_jo I've made both scenes downloadable! Might take a few minutes but just hit the blue download button and you should be able to import the scene above into your 3d software. 

If you do print these please show me the results :D I would love to see this 3D printed 

If any problems arise let me know and ill see what I can do!
@asideofchidori You are seriously the coolest person ever :0
i was a quite shocked because i forgot that garnet have three eyes
BTW can i use this 3D scene in one of the game i'm making?
and i won't forget to give credits to you
Hey, I really love this Jasper model! Will it ever be up for DL? I'm really interested in converting it to MMD.
@seph04 yeah it's easy to forget she has three because of her cool shades! but sure! as long as it's a fan game and not for commercial purposes! 

@Riyuchi I'll be releasing the jasper model pretty soon! I want to update it abit then you guys can have it! :)

@shoeless_jo no u!
Does anyone know how to config a render like this? I love this Cell Shading / Toon Shadder style but i can't get a result like this with Sketchfab.... Help?

Cool !
I love your work a lot.
Another great scene, looks fabulous in VR, staff pick.
This is great!
I'm not sure if you're aware of it or if it even matters for final project this was for, but the door by the 'State of Oregon' flag only has one side. I'm only bringing it up because the corridor behind the door is modelled so I thought maybe it was something you'd like bringing to your attention? But maybe it doesn't matter? Maybe it just didn't load correctly for me? Either way, this is fantastic. Keep it up.
@steasaurus Good eye! The path down that back corridor was blocked by a drop-down stair to the attic so was only modeled as a backdrop. But your right; the flag is pretty far out from the wall so could probably have used some back faces.
Cool work man!
Amazing!

Wow that is so cool..
FYI link to concept artist xin xia is broken. Nice work!

Amazing texture work! GZ!
It inspires me to create something in this style. Nice work
Really like your works! I have a silly question that I want to ask: what tools do you use to make it?
This is beautiful. The incredible detail for the amount of polys you used blows my mind.
Dude that is a great fucking job. Congrats. Honestly looks like an illustration
Thanks for the staff pick and kind comments! :)
I've used maya photoshop and 3d coat.
it's like architecture, quilting and viking era steampunk all threw in perfect parts of style together
The model itself looks really simple (topo) but the textures, amazing, they do the job !
Nice work, very inspiring. Thank you for sharing :)
Just wanted to let you know that you're featured in IAMAG's Sketchfab Realtime Selection! Congrats!

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-72/
Unbelievable! this light and overall presentation.. this is pure art!
Oh man! Crazy model! :)
very cool!
beautiful!
Wanted to also let you know that this was featured on 3d-station's August Model of the Month! Congrats! 

http://www.3d-station.fr/2016/08/09/sketchfab-modeles-du-mois-aout-2016/
cool!
I Love it, man!! I am a fan of stylized artwork myself,..
currently doing one myseflf,.. but kinda lost in UV placement for uploading here.. 
question: do u place the UV map in one file? or in some separate parts
@shinjou 

I was pretty lazy with the layout since there was no use  to make it game ready so I autounwraped it ;P
 I posted it here http://polycount.com/discussion/173969/handpainted-3d-viking-house#latest
I highly recommend NOT doing this  ^^
Depending on what you do you will need several texture sheets
whoa, so good!!

Love it! We're choosing it for a Staff Pick :)
Hey @christophs,

I noticed you didn't add categories or tags to your model. It's an important thing to do so it'll show up in the right galleries, getting you more exposure!
Glad you think so @pcmonster! Thanks for the staff pick @nataliak! I appreciate the heads up @bartv should be good now.
@christophs excellent, thanks :)
Well, I've got the same feeling before, doing pure diffuse gives the model a different vibe! Good work!
@davidfuentes I like the idea of being able to control the lighting through texture. Definitely has it's own feel I agree :). Thanks!
Actually I did that in lighting with diffuse in one model I uploaded recently (well, my acc is new anyway lol)
This looks so amazing! And the textures are really nice :)
How long did she take to model?
Very cool work! Textures are beautiful :)
@davidfuentes Yeah you can definitely still get a nice style with lighting too :p

@kashu Thanks! Took about a week if I remember right :)

@kevinpanian Thank you! Glad you like em :)
Very Amazing. Wish you'd made a tutorial for this. Would've love to make soemthing similar
@nghiahuynhsj Thanks! The process is actually pretty straight forward. Put simply I just line up the model with the concept art to get the silhouette and proportion. Then I paint the textures as you would an illustration. I paint in lighting with the intention of light coming down from above in a kind of ambient way. In doing that the lighting doesn't look overly odd when the character is posed or in motion.
Executing this cleanly is hard to do. Very nice work!
@babies-4-cash Thanks! I do what I can :)
Man im tellin' ya my son loved this brave defficit game so much haha damn i miss my son so much.

I absolutely love this! Amazing design.
This looks great!! Love the detail in the undercarriage.
Fantastic!
Holy shmoly!
Super cool! I believe with a bit more power on the idle hoovering effect will give it better feeling of fying. Nonetheless cool flying vehicle!
Bottom panel has no connection to body. Something missing.
That looks awesome, I wish I could do that but If I could I would make it more industrial looking!! :D
Is this for the upcoming CD Projekt RedCyberpunk game?
@Blitzwood No, it is not. :)
Wow simply beautiful! what are your inspirations behind this design?

So good.  I love the fish being sliced as a little funny point.  Great job overall.  =D
This is definitely my favourite so far! You really digged the style and matched it with a nice professional presentation!

This is stunning, but honestly it looks a lot better without the post processing
Simply amazing!!!
Yeah I'd have to agree with the previous comment... Looks loads better without the post processing!
Amazing model & textures :)
Awesome, great lighting on the MS, baked right? Only thing I would say is maybe have the leaves aligned with the curvature of the mesh somewhat, rather than sticking out like that.
Amazing :D
I like it
This is so cool!
Really liking your style. Awesome collection of models dude!

I wish there is an option to make it opaque because lines in the background
@abhay It's made of splines not solid geometry, so it's not really easy to do. I did however make the internal lines lighter so they don't clash. but i find the rear lines to be the best part of doing because when drawing, you need to know the placement of the far jaw+ ear.
interesting!!
This is gold! Thank you for making this!
this is one of the most useful drawing tools! thank you so much for making this!!!

awesome :) i want one so badly :p
badass and suuperhot
Nice!!!!!!!
What about that Fate quote on the wing, am i only one?
@kilex I see you've spent sometime checking out this model xD. Yes, it is an easter egg I put in the texts, I love Type Moon :p. If you look care fully you can find the whole Unlimited Bladeworks poem in there.
@zeroswat well of course, you don't see model like this even in games so... idk maybe i love it a bit XD who knows but i rate it 100/10
@kilex Actually I did make a little game for her, you can find it here https://www.artstation.com/artwork/86gVn ( There is some video in there too). Unfortunately the project is over 60GB so I cannot ship them to anybody
@zeroswat Oh... i don't know what to say except AMAZING. I mean look at those details and hard work and that big map and.... *ahem* also 'a little game' bigger than GTA V XD don't be so modest this is the best thing i've seen in my short life (i'm 18 and aspiring to be a game creator, you motivated me just now endlessly). If this game was released i'd definitely buy it great job!

P.S. It kinda gives off a feeling like you brought parts of a place where you live inside of that 'little game' and it's so detailed that i don't know what to say ... just ... maximum respect for you!
can I get a download of this model please
I love what you've done here- concept, design, all of it is inspiring and amazing. If you ever offer this this model for download, I would love to use it in an animated film- crediting you fully for the model of course.
i love it,thank you for you share!!?????
she is wonderfull and beautiful. i just love cynerpunk stuff since bubblegum crissis from the 80 :D awesome work
i would to take the gun and seperate it as a pickup weapon,
and have that main model rigged to ue2 base anim or udk/ue3 
(cuz it has better anim info ability for effects on import and the actor(x) script is better suited to that sophisticated mesh lod)
but since it's not modular i know it would work for the ue2 anim, and since no hairs you'd lose no detail during reimport
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KldcFJViHU
(*the only thing is i'd drop all the mapping from true color to 256) 
shading/lighting/bump/spec/enviro etc, but it isn't such a big thing once it's in game, a lot of the detail comes back
i need really nice looking content for my game, and i want to disguise the engine i'm using
you won't believe it, but all my imports are for ue1

i meet sellers halfway by asking for ue2/udk rigged work,
i do the conversions for/to ue1 on my end, i'm quite good at it.

thanks for your time, i hope we can do business.
Very nice design. Reminds me of the Wasp from Ant Man move

Nice model and animation. But it's a shame the wrists are rotated incorrectly. Theropod dinosaurs could now hold their hands like this. The hands faced inwards, not down.
Nice work!

The feathers are inaccurate (I know, gonna get flack for saying that), though. Never been found to have them.
@rolandixor It isn't inaccurate to give Compsognathus feathers (although, these feathers are inaccurate).

Compsognathus ancestors and descendants both have preserved feathers, so yes, it is accurate, nigh, necessary, to reconstruct Compsognathus with feathers (in order to be an accurate reconstruction).

That being said this reconstruction is inaccurate (seemingly deliberately so, and nothing is wrong with that), the feathers cling to the body unnaturally, the wrists are pronated, and it's too thin.
@tapejara22 no, what has been found (for certain) is fibers, not feathers. That's a matter of interpretation. Collagen fibers are the most straight-forward and logical explanation (especially with how close to the bone these fibres are), yet, they are reported as feathers to bolster a viewpoint that isn't even held by all of the scientific community. Not everyone is convinced that dinosaurs evolved into birds (even among those who believe in evolution), and there's a good reason for that.
@rolandixor Yah no.

Everyone in the scientific community who does genuine study on dinosaur taxonomy believes the bird relation. There is irrefutable evidence for and none against. Are you actually trying to claim that the impressions from animals like Microraptor and Archeopteryx are collagen fibers? that's ludicrous. 

You're also quick to imply that evolution isn't well accepted by science, which is completely untrue.
Well, I'm done with this convo.

super itseez3d...kudos and all the best ...we are loving it
how to make it? can we take some pictures or video to make the model :)
upload the model to Threedbook at https://www.threedbook.com/detail/10332. if it's uncomfortable for you, tell me, i'll delete it in from threedbook.
@bright First you need an iPad and Structure Sensor (structure.io). You may watch our tutorial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coYebICo2O8&index=1&list=PLDdNlBHHu4Dk6HS2N2ETLuRwenFQ6SGcP where we scan Marina. Also there is Quick start here http://itseez3d.com/faq.html where you can find more details to start scanning with itSeez3D.
It's Ok with Threedbook.
Great

That's really really cool!
That's awesome! Staff Pick :)
Which software did you use to create the diffuse on this model? , im trying to find something where i can just paint over the model. etc
@carlosloggiodice You can paint over a model with Blender :)
That is just awesome! Really nice shading and texturing.. so simple so cool..^^
clever, very clever =^. ^=
Howdy! I just featured you in my weekly Sketchfab round up on BlenderNation:

http://www.blendernation.com/2016/01/04/my-favourite-blender-3d-designs-on-sketchfab-this-week-6/

Enjoy :)
That is so cool. But even though I downloaded the file I don´t quite understand hte materials. I have so much left to learn! I love the outline!
can you make a tutorial..??
@billgozec @elbriga @james @samsake @belich @bartv Thank you all for your comments.
@sussi @rjfriginal  Thank you for commenting, you can take a look at this model, I made it to explain my creation process:  https://sketchfab.com/models/3577d9e6196f49b78181ba9a504204f5

I think  C model is much more easy to do, or at least you need less time to do it.
@carlosloggiodice As @sheeloo  already answered you, you can use Blender to paint over the model and that is the software I use.
nice
We recommended your work for this month's Sketchfab roundup on 3DTotal:

http://www.3dtotal.com/index_news_detailed.php?id=15151&type=2

nice technik
you clever dog you. well done!
You know that you can change the background color instead of a white box.
@Alex_F Yes I Know that, but I uploaded all my models before that feature was available.
Thanks!
@luyssport I didn't know that.
Sencilla pero impresionante técnica!
so cooooooooooooool~
As simple as genius! Incredible!
Good rendering!

@plasma8808 I'm looking for one, can't seem to find it.
Can you put a download link for it in here? I wanna use it in VRChat
can you put a dl for it in fbx or something pls :3
@plasma8808 There is a mmd download version in the workshop's descriptions. However, I won't be making this downloadable for just the model, since the entire model had been converted to be used in Gmod only.
@MissionApollo7 If you're looking for the MMD version, it's here: https://twitter.com/CCrusherP/status/923729868256350209 

But I can't guarantee it has been converted for VRChat. The DL for the Monika model in preview on this page can't be converted for VrChat since its been heavily re-modified to be used in Gmod.
@kamrensh Unfortunately I won't be, but if you're keen on the original MMD DL, here it is: https://twitter.com/CCrusherP/status/923729868256350209
@haoliu95 find the MMD version, use a blender plugin called Cats Blender Plugin, it can load it into Blender and then save it as whatever you want, don't forget to click fix model to get all the textures on automatically
null
I run this through Blender, but when I import into Unity, I get this difference (also, it looks like the skirt doesn't have a mesh on the inside, meaning in VRChat there wont be a texture applied to the inside of the skirt):
Blender: https://gyazo.com/5db24d6aa3033e3ac4870325abeff3a8
Unity: https://gyazo.com/f2377b478689c6645588baa97e6e69e2
I'm fairly certain that this isn't allowed by Tda's rules.

hi, im new to this site, how can I download this and open in in blender?

@FilipAAOfficial 

You are welcome to use it, that's the exact reason why I have it available to download.

I'd like to see the finished version of the project when you do!
Hi, 

If I were to post any of your models as a mod to BeamNG.DRIVE. 

How would you like to get credited?  

Thanks for time and answer.
@levski2000 If they are ported to Beamng Drive, credit me as Renafox and link to my sketchfab profile

Also link me the mod, I'd like to try it out :3
@kryik1023 

I used your 1978 Dodge to make several wonderful cars: 1976-1978 MoPar series of Plymouth and Dodge. 

Now knowing you're a dude though I have to change the READ.ME credits file to them.
very nice
Good
Awesome work Renafox! Thank you.

Check out your cars in an augmented reality test in Downtown Los Angeles:

Excellent! Mandibles, please!!!
Beautifull, I'm printing it! ;-)
very nice .........thank you 
stevep
fantastic!!!Thank's
I uploaded a new version of the scan. More detail, better texture, and should be suitable for 3D Printing (no holes).
600 000 polys is overkill for online viewing, but since download is allowed on this model, I figured I might as well upload a high poly version.
Thanks for your donloaded file. I realised this model with 3D printer color. Look the picture on twitter or facebook (3DLOUIS)

Hi Benoit, and thank you once again for the great scan!

If you are curious, I practiced texturing on a lowpoly version of your scan, in metal - https://skfb.ly/6xRVG - and wooden - https://skfb.ly/6xRVH - versions.

Thanks for the download!
thank you~
Congratulations on reaching 1000 followers @shadows44 - I've been a fan for a long time and it's great to see more people discover your work!
@nebulousflynn Wow, I hadn't noticed ! Thanks, by the way !
To celebrate the milestone, I just switched more than 10% of my 3D scans to downloadable (under CC licence / attribution & non-commercial use).
Just sent to my Form2 printer!
Thank's a Lot! ;)
This is amazing! Do you know the dimensions of the skull so I can scale it to full size? Thank you!
absolutely beautiful I whould give this 6/5 stars (or 12/10 depending what you use)

Model is not loading.
We're looking in to the issue of this model not loading.
We'll fix this issue later today. A quick fix for now is to add '?graph_optimizer=0' to the URL.

@rstr_tv did you remove the textures by any chance? They seem to have disappeared. Let me know if you didn't , which would mean we've run into another bug :(
@Bart yes, I removed textures trying to find out what is wrong with the model loading
Ok thanks, glad to hear we didn't break another thing! I'll let you know when the fix is online.
Awesome attention to detail. Looks so real to life.
We've fixed the loading issue, sorry for the inconvenience!
@Bart Thanks!
Looks fantastic! Staff Pick!
Just dropping by to let you know that we shared this on social! Hope more people come to appreciate it as much as we have!
@rstr_tv I just checked it out in VR and it looks great! I added it to our featured VR collection https://sketchfab.com/sketchfab/collections/sketchfab-vr-showcase-desktop

Beautiful composition. While minimalist, it's a very believable coral + shore.

Thx u so much @fergalicia !  For the face, I studied the time lapse of Sergi Caballer. I am currently on another fanart. When it is finished I will post the whole process in video.
This looks amazing man. I have looked around and came back to this maybe 20 times. I would really like to see your process for texturing something like this. Did you properly open UVs and painted it on photoshop? Or maybe you used zbrushs spotlight to stamp original concept to the 3d mesh and continued to paint the rest in zbrush? Either way amazing work I would really like to see your process!!
Hi @sarpserter Thx u so much. I'm currently working on a new fanart for now. 
I record absolutely everything in real time. When all is over I will post the videos.
And i painted everything on photoshop. I havnt use an other software. Maya for modeling. Photoshop for Texturing. ?

Great Shapes!

The VRChat version is up! For those that have purchased this, please verify that everything works and notify me if there are any problems.
@deuschanz so small complaint it seems the oppai physics are a little over exaggerated moving part of the lower chest, not a big deal just some other vrchat players have mentioned this issue and thought I would post about it. overall its an amazing model and ill defiantly keep using it!!
@slickshot131 noted. 

@Scena  (we took the oppai joke literally too far LMAO)
@deuschanz yeah I also found out the model does not like me trying to remove the skirt lol it kinda pulls the textures and goes crazy lol xD I thought it would be nice have one model with and one without the large skirt on. reveling the mini skirt for a little change on the character model in game.
To all who are considering purchasing Korwa, since the VRC update to a newer version of unity, her VRC SDK 's animations are broken, along with other extra VFX which was added. 

I am bumping down the price till @Scena  gets the time available to fix these issues. 

To existing owners, a fix will be implemented within a few weeks, this issue is out of our control. Thank you for understanding.
The model is now fixed and updated for the latest version of VRC, additionally : 
-Oppai physics has been toned down and fixed
-Clothing glitch has been fixed
-Animations have now been optimized for the correct timings

Previous purchasers can update it for free by downloading the latest file 

Let me know if there are any problems :3
Hey all! We've made a discord to answer your questions related to importing Korwa into VRChat : https://discord.gg/mytQvXZ

hi! just wondering if i could download it for gmod? it said on your description i could
@Tekx http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695026151 Here you go :)
@Pipann Thanks!!
also wondering what do you use to make your models
@Tekx I use 3ds Max 2016
I just joined, how do you download files
@killorbekilled If available the download button is just below the model viewer. This model isn't available for any individual downloads though. It is however available on SFM and GMod. :)
Its me! AWESOME Work
This model is absolutely AMAZING. the details and everything are exactly what says sans to me. I would love to use this model in some animations, (full credit would be given to you in the credits/description if i put it up online) but there's no download link... so yeah.
IKR @Jackj106
IKR @Jackj106
Hi Pipann, I was wondering why you can't make them downloadable here or at least in a different file format. I have a 3D printer and wish to print your Sans and Gaster Blaster Skull. The one on SFM aren't compatible with 3D printing programs. Could you at least send them to me through email or something? Thanks.
@Josh.Ackroyd The reason they're not downloadable here is because I do not want them to be. They are merely here for show. Next to that a model must be 'watertight' (have no gaps in the geometry and be a single object) in order to print them, and my models are not optimized for that.
@Pipann Okay then. It’s a shame because I’m sure I could have made it work but if you don’t want to share then that’s fine.
heya
how i can download it?
Is there anywhere I can find a 2d mesh of this model? You've made the best Sans model i've ever seen but I can't figure out how to get a flat for it ;~;

@bartv thanks!
Really nice!

Is the animation empty? If you delete it in 3D Settings, it will remove the timeline UI and I think it will also improve viewer performance as we can optimize the scene graph for static models.
Oh by the way, I don't think this model belongs in 'Places & Scenes' - I'll remove that category.
Looks lovely! What language is that?
@essimoon thanks! it's Thai — i'm not a speaker, but i know it's something about food :)
Dude, that's so sick!

awesome
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

Nice work. Specific details like the propane tank and CFL bulb to me really sell this. Is there a prototype?
Love the cartoony style and materials!

@avikbellic911 The iris is intruded into the eye while the eye ball is hollow. So it would appear that she's always looking at the viewer. You can zoom up-close with the wireframes turned on to see how it's done.
incredible effect on the eyes, love it!
hi,you can link to?)
Can I borrow your model?
@Shiroe.Kurogeri You mean this model in particular? No, but thanks for asking. There are other free models you may download that I've uploaded.
I can only appreciate the artwork of the 3D model is he add the download link to this model.
This is sooo good in so many levels :-)
You have done a very good job with her.
Amazing!
I love it, but sadly its not downloadable :/
Hello, how much for the model?
@Arngrim I'll put her up for sale at some point, no worries.

@GHPurple Cool, I hope you do
Hi, could you make a custom Kosmos in Swimsuit with some adjustments just for me? Of course I will pay)) I am new here, so do not know how to DM you. Could you contact me please?

Sketchfab needs to add custom shader support - if we could put the current camera pos in the shader, then grav lensing would look properly from all angles.
@serioussam909  indeed :D
I love this artwork.
I did come across an image on the apod.nasa.gov sight that showed a gravitational lens. 
Very odd. The problem with singularities is that light cannot escape so how do you represent it
graphically.

p.s. I used to work at NASA Langley.
Here is an example:

https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1511/cheshirecat_chandra_comp1024c.jpg
What's inside?
@vicenxvives Matter energy, but mostly hopes and dreams...
@lmatthias 
i know grav lensing wasnt supposed to be looked like that, sorry its only an approach..
i hope i can do better next time.

graphycally, hmmm... i believed you already noticed i only used 2 sided shader to give the lensing illusion
but perhaps using the new shader i can do better..
@vicenxvives If a black hole is an oyster,then the singularity's the pearl inside.
:D
What program i need to open the file with?
because it looks like a weird sun with rings
Man, this looks amazing.. its exactly like Gargantua in Interstellar :D

You did great work here, I downloaded this on the spot. Thanks for sharing it with us!
I LOVE IT, YOU ARE AMAZING THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

D'awww. Well done :)
I love these guys :)
Thanks Guys , Im looking forward to this movie ;)
I keep looking at this model, great work @Shaderbytes! Super cute scene and beautiful realisation.
Thanks @alban .. and it has a fire hydrant - a sketchfab 3D scan subject favorite haha
Indeed! As soon as I saw It I sent a note to @PadreZippo asking him if he would scan the model from his screen :)
Some technical info for anyone interested :

• The entire scene is baked on one large 4096x4096 texture in Blender Cycles at 2000 samples
• I used the sIBL Walk_Of_Fame HDR and one sun lamp for lighting.
• No post production was done on the baked texture results

In Sketchfab :

• While the sharpen camera effect has its place for some models it should not be used everywhere as in this scene. It is softened up by a bloom with a  high radius and high threshold and very low intensity.
• I tweaked the contrast/brightness/saturation sliders slightly to compensate the bloom effect.
BlenderNationed! :)

No work

@orhanalkan sorry to hear you had some problems , did you try refreshing the page, perhaps open close your browser , restart your machine? Perhaps Sketchfab's service went down for a short while- I'm not sure.  There is nothing more I can say over the problem you had , the page is working fine on my machine right now and has been working fine on many other users machines as well. If your problem persists it would be best to start a thread in the forums in the support section. Hope you get it sorted out ;)
So cool !

Great modeling.  The colors are well done, and I respect the ornament on the hat and boots.

@joshpurple Thanks, currently redoing/ upgrading our animals library. Animations were OK but definitely needed some more love.
@iggy-design Thanks
@charlos Thanks, old school technique that is still really useful and still definitely looks good enough. For this one It needed to follow the fur flow and not just be spiky / sticking out.

Hi there!

Is this model now available on the Unity Asset Store?
Could you please provide a link in the description?

Having 4-6 LOD versions of it would be a boon :)
@protofactor 
There is a little animation error except that this little mistake as a whole is a great job!

i like it
@UgLey did you ever get the download? i would love to play with this Model as well :) thanks
Could I download this file to 3D print ?
This mars project has many of us earthlings really hyped!

@gorodork You're telling me that download is the model shown here? The file you've linked which is only 1.66 MB? You're ridiculous any model even close to this shown here would be much, much larger. If that isn't a virus I sure as hell don't know what would be.
Would be willing to offer a small amount of cash for this model though. I have 0 clue as to why this guy just won't sell it here. It's clear whatever he included it in doesn't really exist. Or if it does literally too obscure to ever find.

@kamijihi  this video help me with promblem and got down some https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W_AKmqJGY8, 
I'm still learning on how to upload but share the models for free
@Ty.Skipper thanks i wil try it out the model looks good
null
Why's she so shiny?
how do i import dis correctly?
please help
How do I upload this to unity? It's downloading as a zip file and im not sure how to import it to unity pleasee help!
@Alex.Strati You need to first open the model in Blender and then export is as an FBX file, then you can import that FBX file into Unity. If you're trying to upload this model to VRChat, I hope you know how to decimate the model because it has WAY too many polygons.
@tingy thank you so much!
@tingy the files wont actually open in blender? Idk if i'm doing it incorrectly though because I've never used blender :(
@Alex.Strati You only need to open (either by double clicking, or dragging and dropping) the file called Megumin.blend that's in the source folder, don't worry about the textures folder
@tingy it just isnt working for me when i try to import to unity now i give up :(
@Alex.Strati To be honest, I'd wait for another Megumin model, or for Carl to fix this one. Has way too many polygons anyways, even after decimating the model.
Thanks for the model :)

@nataliak Yes it will be! Just thought I'd post it here to test out the materials before assembling everything, still a long way to go...
Great! Can't wait to see it :)

really cool!
The rebels should have put all of their available units of their fleet at their disposal to make a last ditch effort.
Nice !

But where is Endor ? ^^
really cool!I like star war!
Could you please provide the textures? Just got the model without any textures.

This is the coolest model I've ever seen. GREAT JOB!!!!

Nice Model. Looks great!!
i looked it up and this is the exact copy...DAMN!!
Very nice model!

Perferct!!!!!
Incredible! Very Nice model!
Nice work, but it's silly to put a license on this to give you credit and can be used for commercial work. Really?
Hey very nice model!
Unfortunately I feel like there are some textures missing :'(
(Importing the FXB in Blender and trying to figure out which texture belongs where ;) )
Hey! Very nice model. How can I download it? Kinda new here
Can I have this. Its very shmexy
@gumml How did you get the model?

did you make this out of 3d scanned models?
I am new to this site, thus i apologise for not understanding. 

I need to 3d print some human figures for a visualisation. 

How can i buy or obtain an .stl file of these 3d models?
@needsart you can contact me and tell me what kind of models do you need.(small detail..male..female..dressed..naked). I am a 3D Mastermind Senior and i can very easy and fast make you 15-20 Pose like or Portret like.even more. (or both in the same package)any size STL Objects and Characters for 1$..just for fun and for the sake of art..
@darklordflash Hi, please contact SIM TRAXX fb or my account on sketchfab or actraxx..gmail.com 
We need some 3d rally spectators. Thanks
@konglowbal Hy there i will be happy to help you, i am making my own 3rd Person Space shooter in my studio with my team and i know how to prepare clean quad geometry low and high-poly, non-overlapping and UV manually relaxed. I understand that Rally Spectators have to be many and low poly with tangent  normal maps for detail. (i can also provide the object-space normal maps and displacement maps) and of course the Texture map. all with padding 3... or as you wish..I can all so provide a set of animation ..(hand waving, applaud, cheer, jump etc.) we already have a lot of content to adapt don't worry.  I will like to know what engine do you use..


My question is How many do you need ? (female and male)..children and old people.. and how many animation? or what kind of animation. if you do not have a special request i will Freestyle a Pack for you...and you can pay me as much as you wish, i really don't need your money..I take random tasks so i can teach my team different techniques to model in Max and sculpt or export tex' in Zbrush and other software.

Owh damn, the lighting is baked ? Thats smart, the texture inspector is a super neat feature for dissecting models and learning :)
Hi! I just purchase cosmonot model from Gumroad  to rig but ?t seems very difficult to make it so far. Is it possible to have it with T-Pose. Could you send it if it is possible. Thank you so much!!

@bartv Thank you so much!
really really nice
great model! thank you
Great
good boat.
nice boat that must have taken a long time good job :)
Excellent how long did it take to make?
My company needs about a hundred different pbr vessels like this.
Are you looking for work?
@diplodosaur I'm always looking for work, but I am unsure if I'd be able to deliver 100 PBR vessels, this took a while to make
@kryik1023 Well this won't be 100 at once I imagine. We have to replace our old models but I'm not sure how much the management is willing to pay per model, so that's why I was asking how long it took to make this one.
The crew is not there and the fish too ... This is Flying Dutchman ...)
Any chance you could make a tugboat variant of this model?
Amazing how you can do like this ...   :) ...

well done :)
@assassinsusie you wanna know how i got it so right? because i thought of you!! and how much you would enjoy it!!
@alban wow i cant can't wait to spice this up with the soon-to-come audio feature of sketchfab!!
this platform just rocks for artists and audience alike!!
@gerpho i am glad you like it!! i attempted this out of the bloom, i only saw your comment on @alban 's model after i posted mine, while i look at other maodels with similar tags. Pixar fans think alike i suppose!!
Well done! You really captured it well.
By the way, I've cleaned up your categories - please pick them carefully :)
@bartv thank you!! i will be careful next time!! Again means alot you guys like it!!
Nice animation!
I really love it and keep coming back to it, so giving it a staff pick!

Just a small suggestion: would be nice to have the wall as a sphere, so that it's not cut with the rest of the background.
This is one of a handful of models to have given me a nostalgia trip. I bet that most people who view this will hear the sound effects in their imagination. Good study!
Excellent. :) Just the last turn of the head is too quick.
@alban OW!!! i am very happy that you like it so much!! I am so honored to get a staff pick!! It really means alot knowing that i can spread joy through art!!
 a giant shpere (closed surface, maybe a smooth cube) that doesn't break the illusion?
sounds manageable!
hm should i try to update this model?
@araon Glad you like it!! I see your point. it is indeed a bit quick..
null
@vibrantnebula Couldn't agree more!! I am so lucky to have grown up with pixar animations, dating back the toystory, one after the other... Features, shorts, When i was 8 and saw the making of monster Inc. in the DVD... holy Luxo junior what the hey is that sorcery!! i knew i wanna do 3d art!!
And when my family visited to UC berkeley, i beg them to drive me to Pixar HQ and i took a pic at the front door!!
@twitte_king yes, you can simply reupload it, everything else including the 3D settings will stay unchanged.

@tzeshi and @mestaty, thank you so much guys, i am honored!

@Pippykins, thank you! i did do a rough sculpt for my first version of her but i repainted almost all of it since then XD
i usually do prefer sculpt to low for characters, but time to time i just go straight to low for hand painted models. 
i'm currently doing that for my Captain Fortune fan art that should be done and out in a few days :D

@graograman, thank you! :)

Hi. I really like the Osiris. What's the intended role of this ship? Looks a bit like a cargo hauler. I want this one more implemented, than any of the Next Great Starship stuff.
beautiful ship!
be3llo mi piace questo modello di navetta spaziale con reattori orientabili  saluti marco  italia
Awesome!
bellissimo navetta spasziale e texture e perfetta mi piace molto costruzione tipo  il fil prometeus   comunque favoloso  marco lovi toscana italia
Man what tier did you picture this ship as and what functions can it perform? I'd like to know and I hope when your all done this can be added to the Game it's beautiful and very different from what SC has.
Amazing model !
Great job, how to download ?

@joshpurple : thanks! :) updated the viewer with some few animations...
And great animations :) !
Damn you're good. Superb work. I won't write a comment on each and every of your meshes. But they all deserve the same enthusiasm. Great work !
Can’t view the animation
@Juanjose09 not sure what's going on with this model. We can view the animation on our end however the model is all messed up. We tried to re upload it several times without luck... Sorry about the inconvenience.
@bartv hey, did you guys change anything in the 3d viewer recently? for some reason this model isn't displaying properly. I imported the model inside 3ds max and everything is fine. Any idea what could be going on? Thanks in advance for your time.
@bartv there is clearly a weird issue. the thumbnail 360 preview doesn't show the messed up model but when in the viewer the model is messed up.
@protofactor Could you please email support@sketchfab.com about this and include specific information about your browser and OS?
@bartv Thanks you for the prompt reply. Is it displaying properly on your end? I just updated another model and the same  issue is happening...
@protofactor Yes, it's fine for me. This may be an issue with the new Firefox 62 on Windows only.
What happened to this model? The fur textures on the tail are broken, and the bumpmapping around the facial region looks off. It wasn't like this last time I checked.
@APS4745 thanks for reporting this. It should be fixed now.
hi, can i use this is AR? in sumerian ?
@arunjsne in therory you should be able to use this model anywhere. AS long as you can make sure it meets the application's requirements (model format, polycount limit etc...)

What kind of camera do you use to shoot such monument?
@John38 ; Thanks ! I still use my Nikon D800 camera, with the 70-200 VR2 lens. And I shoot from a Cessna with an open window.
@gerpho ; Thanks for the details. Can I ask how many pictures were necessary to complete the 3D scene? Were all pictures taken used in the 3D process? Thanks
@John38 About 300 photos (35Mpixels each). I don't waste tim in sorting the photos, if some are outside the scene they are rejected, but all the pictures containing the scene were used. I probably could have done with less, but I alwys prefer to be on the safe side even if there are more photos than strictly needed.
Thanks, do you use custom Region of Interest when processing the 3D scene?
@John38 Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean by region of interest. In this case, I just let the software determine  the bounding box, hence the rather jagged edges.
@gerpho this is still pretty cool ;)
@pa Thanks.
It reminds me I forgot to mention its a Unesco World heritage site. I'll correct this
@gerpho; In CC, once the AT is done and before doing the 3D reconstruction, you can chose to set a Region of Interest, manually in moving the edge of the box or by importing a custom ROI in kml. This can help reducing the size of the area or removing unwanted bounding items.
@John38 Ah yes, sorry, I call it Bounding Box. I use this feature very often, but in this case I didn't. I wanted to keep the sandy surroundings at low tide. So I left the default parameters.
Marvallous model, Gerpho, despite the constraint of distance!
@HoangHiepVu Thanks a lot !
Is it better that Sketchfab can insert (automatically or not) the sun in this model? I see shadow and I expect to see a sun in the sky in opposite direction :) @pa
wow!
This is incredible, thanks @gerpho!!
Love it!
Wow!
Awesome!

@maddytaylor I can respect that. Thank you
Hey, i really  love this model! ^^ I want to print Zyra for a friends birthday that's coming right up and i wanted to ask if you'd be willing to share your model for that? ^^
Oh nevermind, i just saw that a person asked something similar. ^^

@andrewnorthern2 Yes, ofcourse. The model is available for download. I will be glad if you send me photos of 3D printing to my e-mail.

@pluto.is.just.a.rock Thank :)
Wondering if I could get this 3D Model in hopes to download it and 3D print at a later time. Not for resell, but for my own enjoyment. If it fine with you please let me know. Ty.
Hi! great work!
would it be possible to have the model? I'd love to texture it
@cosmos28 Sorry i'm late.It all ready to download.
@Ichentogo Sorry i'm late.Please take photo to me when your print finish.
@kunnatee I'm print it right at this very moment. I'll show it when it done as requested. I sure hope others like you allow ppl like me to do this as well. Should put this on myminifactory.com or thingiverse.com
what software do you use
@DEXDEX I work in 3D Max.
So cooooollll! Thank you!
Whooping cool
Thanks for this, it was so helpfull for me!!
How can I use it after downloading it? I am a beginner
if someone makes a neo zeong that can have this fit in it i will die peacefully
@bannaxiaoge 

You need a 3D modeling software to open this file, like 3ds max, Maya, sketchUp
excellent
@kunnatee  are you aware someone has made commercial use out of this 3d model tracing it over and selling it as their own https://seanplenahan.blogspot.com/2019/07/msn-04-sazabi-poster-tee-and-phone-case.html
@truonginator Thank you.I don't know that befor.?

@portugueseotaku Yes, it does do that. I just couldn't be bothered with making an additional empty case. It flies by so fast that you can't quite tell anyway. You can also notice the hammer doesn't cock when the gun fires, again, cus it's almost impossible to tell.
bonito
Hey, I removed the category Science & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
Hey, I tried extracting the .zip file in Source folder and it was damaged :/
I tried to repair the archive but failed...
Can you upload a new one please or just send me a link or whatever ?
@IsaacStreaky I tried too. It didn't say it was damaged, but i did get an error and couldn't open it. But it was not local to this model, it's like that on others too, so it must be Sketchfab's fault somehow. 
Did you try the other download option, though?
@FrenchBaguette Thanks for the reply, mate. I downloaded some other M1911 model like 2 days ago and now when i tried downloading the same one, it gave me error. Then i downloaded your's and got same error. I think you are right....it might be SF's fault
BTW, why is the part below hammer moving just after the bullet is fired ?
Does it move in real life or is it just modelling error ?
@IsaacStreaky It's a safety mechanism, and yes, it does move. In order to fire the gun, that leaver has to be pressed down. So you have to be actually holding the gun on order to pull the trigger.

OMG I cant believe that I can use this on a game.

I love this model but would like to know what the purple lines represent, please.
@SusanBratton Hi, I've made this model with blender, following researcher Odile Fillod instructions. I've only done the technical part of the work.

My page :
http://philippe.cosentino.free.fr/tests/clitoris3d/

Odile Fillod page :
http://carrefour-numerique.cite-sciences.fr/fablab/wiki/doku.php?id=projets:clitoris

The purple lines represent the Kobelt venous plexus.
This is awesome. Thank you.
Hi Philippe,
I'd like to know if you'd be willing to create another of these models without the nerve plexus? And if you'd allow me to use it in a video I've recorded about the clitoral structure and engorgement for YouTube?
Susan Bratton Better Lover on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_c9AuBB96f_k8k56UXr9qQ
@SusanBratton credits must also go to Odile Fillod.

She shares the model on her page :

Hi there, is it possible to order a print of this? I work as a yonimapper, and it would be brilliant for educating women. Some of my colleagues would probably also like to order.

Awesome!
I knew this was your work before I even saw who it was. Your'e a master at this stuff, man!
Amazing as always ;) What texture resolution are you using on sketchfab. Is there a way to turn off antialiasing? Those pixels look super sharp
@eliteabix @Gandalf..White Thank you so much that means a lot from both of you!

@graft Still low-res textures (128px etc.) but with 'Nearest Neighbour' filtering set in the texture settings instead of Bilinear etc. - that's how you avoid the blurred antialising :D And thanks!
@artofsully thanks for answering my question. Im planning to make some 3d pixel art and i'm gathering knowledge :D
I spent an hour just zooming in and out of this model, pretending I was walking around in it. Excellent work!
This is amazing work, good stuff!
Looks great definitely did the master chief nice and cortana sweet. ?
@raptorex2000 Haha that's so cool! I'm really happy you enjoyed it!
@Tskate @chewster23 Thank you guys so much, I'm glad you dig it!

The diffuse texture is a bit too noisy imo, so I've uploaded a pure white version: https://skfb.ly/EoAE
The lighting on the inside is pretty awesome too, you should set up some annotations for a tour!
Fantastic!
Really impressive! And really cool that you can see inside the building as well.
Thanks!

@bartv I've reupload the model and added indoor glowmap. Not really sure whether or not to bake the AO into diffuse map to save file size, the page keep crashing or fail to load all the textures :\  Also had to google a lot of cathedral architecture terms for the annotations :P
@patrix great work as always. The architecture is a bit more accurate than your previous cathedral :P

Very heavy loading, but I guess there's not much to do about that :/
I really enjoyed that, thanks!
Annotations are a cool addition, great job! I think this is a good example of a model where a list of the annotations on a side menu would be good to click though maybe as a future feature for sketchfab ;)
@wfurneaux thanks for the suggestion. We'll keep it mind for future improvements!
very good likeness of a typical cathedral good job on your research and attention to detail.
I think your job is great, there are a lot of details and it's quite clear. I'm a student and I'm trying to do a kind of online museum for my art teacher, how can I do it? Shall I make files with another app and then upload them here or can I do them here? sorry if I ask you but you seem like an expert and I'm new on this web site. Thank you and sorry for my English. :)
@lux You would need to do the modeling and texturing elsewhere on your prefered 3D app (3dsMax, Maya, Blender, C4D....). Then just upload the model and textures here, maybe even add some annotations for information and a virtual tour guide. For more detailed steps and tutorials, you can go on the Sketchfab Help & FAQ page https://help.sketchfab.com/
Stunning work. Would have never known you've never been in a cathedral at the time without you telling us!
This is a great model regardless of export errors!
Super cool. I exported a small test to 3dsmax. Inside max, I can’t see any triangles. 

But when I import  the geometry into Unreal , the cubes have all triangles. Even when unchecking triangles. I tried .fbx and .obj. But always the same problem... so how did you export/import without getting those triangles? @patrix
very nice. did you get the 3d model from google maps? and if so, how did you get the obj file?

Hey, we featured your model on 3D Printing Industry! Congratulations :) See the article here: http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/08/21/free-3d-printable-of-the-week-a-walking-gun-bot/
hello..i am heru from indonesia..
please help me how to make process or pdf..turitorial..
thanks.......
Very cute!!
There like killer Spider bots with guns, but with 4 legs instead of 8.
@2-Head_Dragon  This is way i called this one gun but and not a gun spider. 
I just decided to make four legs, it's easy to animate and better for the performance, so in game you could put more enemies on the screen at the same time.
Mate please allow commercial use!
where can I download animation for unity3d for free
@nicitosborisov You can download it here.

https://3dhaupt.com/3d-model-my-gunbot-design-download/
3DHaupt, Thank Youuuuuuuuu!  Man! You Have The Most AWSOME An Extensive Collection Of GREAT Models I Ever Seen, Is It Ok? I Used You Gun Bot In This Unity3D Demo, Is In YouTube At:       

    Unity's Turret AI & Quaternion.Lerp Rotations v.02
@toledocodezero24 
Thanks and yes you can use my model for your Unity3D Demo.
Interesting video by the way :)
@dennish2010 
Thank You So Much, I Really Appreciate It...
the blend files don't include the walk animation...but fantastic work!
@jackw11111 Strange? I had uploaded a fbx-file for this scene because there was a 3d-View problem with the blend-file, I think it was the normal-map! But the blend-file should contains all the three animations!
Amazing! Can it be used freely for anything? In what program did you make this? I just started out with iClone and Blender, total noob hoping to learn from anyone:-) Take care all the best Albin

Wich camera did you use? Raw or Jpeg? Shooting settings?
Shadeless version is much better, in my opinion.
Thanks @egiptologo91 , this model is an easy one, which has a lot of textures. I used my Sony A6000 with Sigma 60mm, jpeg, f/3.5, 1/200.
I forgot, iso 100.
Beautiful model!
Thanks @vegasuz !
Is it possible to download this model ?
Yes, I let it downloadable @pattarrian
Many thanks! It was not downloaded during my last visit to the site...
Really amazing! thanks for sharing :)
Thank you @geoffreymarchal !
It's funny how so many of us 3d artists turn to earlier times for inspiration. I am of that rank myself. But I dont exactly understand why.
@IanWilmoth : thanks, and you mean The Renaissance  =)) ?
Well, the renaissance in europe is certainly one of the peak eras of art, but there was a lot going on in Asia too ;)
I noticed there are some blank parts on the texture, I assume its because you couldn't get the camera above the statue. Would that be hard to just fix in photoshop? I appreciate that this is a raw result but as far as something that would be usable in a game or movie or whatever that would need to be fixed.
I don't know how to use Photoshop :D
hello IanWilmoth

You can very simply repair with

https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net

and with netfabb basic

Il is also possible with autodesk remake but with more difficulties
Wow that is a super cool website that I had no idea existed. Next time I have to clean something up I'll give it a try.
Thanks a bundle. Used as a source image for this ink drawing.

Perfect. I like the glass element.
It's so nice! Good work!

@amstanley if you contact me directly (a.ball@nhm.ac.uk) we can discuss this.

That is amazing.  I make some ok ships for no real training in Maya but nothing like that.  May I ask what software you used to make that.
can you add more ships and maps because i am previously making a game on roblox like Star Conflict
Nice
Love the blue and red glow colors. Awesome ship & very lifelike!

why is it not for download if I may ask?
no buddy get away with:we cant show you its only for showcasing. seruosly. why cant you let it be dowloadable? the rabbit raider is downloadable and the bunny brawler isnt. pople cont use the models ij theird games anyways withouth the owner of them letting them to use it. why cant you make it downloadable?
@Adas191 No. We're a website providing a database for users to browse skins, we're not here to distribute them. None of our uploads are downloadable and it doesn't matter what other users do.  Skin-Tracker won't get into legal trouble because people like you demand the models to be downloadable, buddy.
Is it possible to get the 3D model of this skin through game files? Provided ANY method possible.

@marcusthevisual 
I'm don't take commisions. These kind of models take far to long to finish for me to commit for commisions. Thanks for for showing interest though.
@garm No problem, I totally understand :) you did an amazing job with this one! Thanks for the response and keep up the good work.
@garm how long did this model take you, even to animate?
@3dcinetv 
Modeling alone was 10 hours total over a week.

Texturing though was about 15 hours total, possibly more. Handing painting those lines was painful and an experiment I don't intend to repeat for my next model haha.

Rigging was about 1-2 hours (was a simple setup for posing only).

I didn't animate this one, it's just 3 poses that are switching. If I were t animate her, I would need to replace her rig with a more animator friendly one.

Cool
Hey, I removed the category Architecture. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
thanks for sharing these great scans mister devious!

Thanks for the awesome scan! I converted it to a .obj and used it in a VFX rain tutorial of mine. Unfortunately I forgot to mention you in my video (my apologies) but I did make sure to mention you first in the description. If you would like to take a look, it's here: https://www.ninebetween.com/single-post/Tutorial3RainSystems

Thanks again!
Very nice, So many thanks
Gorgeous study. Cheers!

Brilliant!
Fabulous! Looking forward to more 3D oracle bones!
Would it be possible to get a download link for this image?  I'd love to 3D print one for a professor of mine who teaches Chinese history.

Hit myself on the head when I saw this and thought, why didn't I make this?, then I realized I knew you from Jkhub, and you made a thread about this awhile ago. Great job on this!
Super nice, I'd love to see an animated version!
@jamesculley any luck with the animated version yet? :)
@alban Yeah just had a go.. its a port so not quite as I would like it.. but now I know how I will work up a specific little scene for sketchfab animation!!  love it!
https://sketchfab.com/models/fb22c891423a42bf96f229b4a475d6fc
@jamesculley would be cool to reupload this little guy with an animated version :)
@alban would the view count remain if I re-uploaded?
@jamesculley yes, everything will be unchanged, we even keep material setup now
@alban all done!!! :)
@jamesculley neat!
@alban
@alban sorted that shadow floor properly :)
@jamesculley nice, thanks!

Hello, 

Very nice model of the second coolest droid after R2D2 !

I was wondering where (or if...) you found a blueprint for the head ? Without this, all the little panels are a nightmare to model...
@jamesculley Did you disable the download again? I don't have the option :/

@SleepiiRosiie Sometimes when importing to Unity the model is pink, but if you uploading to VRChat and get in game the avatar will not be pink, but, if that is not the problem, I'll tell you step by step of what to do.
Step 1 - In Unity go to the [Lu Chiliarch] folder;
Step 2 - Open [Materials] folder;
Step 3 - Press CTRL+A to select all files;
Step 4 - On the top right corner you will see the number of materials selected and below that it says Shader, next to it you can change the shader; (it sould look like this https://image.ibb.co/bCfUzo/1.png)
Step 5 - Go to [CubeParadox] then [Flat Lit Toon]; (like this https://image.ibb.co/d2g0po/2.png)
Step 6 - For the final touch, copy what you see on the red rectangle (here https://image.ibb.co/khhL5T/3.png) and it's ready to upload.

If you still see her pink, I'll tell you more ways to fix it.
Have fun!
I'm using this for a videogame (I'm going to be putting you In the credits Btw)

@garvamatic @sd1 Thanks you very much!
@geoffreymarchal I wonder if you have scaled this for VR in the 3D settings menu? It would be great to explore this at the correct size.
@seandoran Actually no. But actually the standard parameter were roughly good enough. It give more or less the real size of the mesh.

@chrisleeX Printing it right now, model will be 25cm high... I'll let you know on... Sunday :p (3d of printing)

I tried a 28mm base figure, but the hat border was too thin so it won't print --> FAIL
Vivi <3. Awesome model!
Wow, you've reached 3000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@PauFer Maybe if I have some spare time :)
@mikethelegend Thank you, I'm making a v2 of this map however. I'll upload it soon ;).
@spinofan.10 No problem dude! Yeah, ok. I'll be making the trailer for a FNaF Movie that I might make. If If you want, I can tell you when it's out and give you the link! I do a lot of FNaf things on my channel.
yo thanks ima use this for a fan animation clip... i will be sure to link this in the video cuz this is great
how can i use this for unity?
@Freddyfreds You'll have to convert it your self, or find a converter on the internet so it can be used as a unity model.
DUDE THIS IS LIT! AWESOME MODEL OF THE FNAF 1 MAP DUDE!
thats not 100% correct but i dont think i could make better so good job

Beautiful work deryckeredries. Thank you for sharing!
amazing! I feel like making a digital painting of this
Great job! thanks for sharing!
But why can't i see the texture when i import this beautiful forest? can u help me with that?.
Great forest by the way.
inspirational!
Hi deryck. I love this obj model. very stylized you sir are talented.
I notice you tried to simulate volumetric scatter lighting. I assume those are just alpha textures, but hey, that scene would look pretty cool with a shader eh?
ok so my ulterior motive.. I really REALLY like your model dude. I wanna use it on my demo reel to showcase my volumetric lighting shader, and potentially a few others including fog and floaty kokori forest particles. 
I will put your name with the image any other contact info you want I will include. but let me know if you are okay with this
Hey cieroceramics,

You can certainly use the model and texture. Just credit me with Texture by Dries Deryckere.
The model was given to me by DAE (digitalartsandentertainment.be).
Post a link here when you have a video!

Many thanks, and best of luck.

@paulchambers3d Thank you for adding this as a staff pick. We're honored. Pawel is such a great guy to work with. We're excited to share the full short soon. It's a 3 week production for a workshop we're running.
Awesome!
Awesome! This reminds me of the style we chose for our current project! But it looks even more polished than ours, hope we can achieve a similar quality soon :)
Wow I'm speechless, I love the paintery style of this!
Hey ... WOW.
Absolutely stunning!
Awesome!
This style is fantastic!

The detail in the coiling branches and vines are fantastic.  Nice touches.

Very good modeling / sculpting in generally. And the materials are wonderful, but I can't say the same for the eyes. I think, eyes are the most important part of the organic modeling. For the real expression and the persistent posture it must be done carefully.
This would look stellar if animated!! :D
Nice work !!!!
How can i download?
I want to try make 3d printing 
Thank you
Can you make the model downloadable?
Increible work

Ahah awesome, check this out @ruslans3D! @bartv we should do a contest on this :)
Very cool work! Giving it a Staff Pick :)
@gerpho Merci :D
@lt hey it i've check you site, you have a beautifull collection !
@alban : I can't find this one ! it was brilliant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LncjJzgrKfA
@nataliak A big thanks to you ;)
TY
@R0m1R yeah I know, I LOVED the milkmaid! @sid2941 deleted it, I still don't know why...
@R0m1R you should put the people back, btw :)
@alban it was on the making ....http://puu.sh/k7Up3/7bd9177f7e.jpg
but I think it will demand too much time to get them right ! I was aiming to get this project done in 3 hours, not max and when I've seen that time was going so fast I've decided to concentrate only on the restaurant !

Solution: I could share an .FBX format (texture+mesh) so that you and your friend could redo the scene but with your own scans

this one for examples : 
https://sketchfab.com/models/252b504690b44958af2aa57ef1fdd745
https://sketchfab.com/models/deead583a6fb48c6aa43fea5f2936349

You will be able to do a re-interpretation of this famous painting !
@R0m1R fair enough :)
Oh my god... Thank you so much! My favorite picture
Nice work :)
wonderful, moody  dimensional hommage
Beautiful. This is my favorite paint of him.
Congrats!
Hi, Im interested in using your 3d model for a video, and I was wondering if you were interested in selling me the model. Hope to hear back from you, thanks.
magnifique *_* j'adore la texture des cafetières :)
That is really good what you did, a 'live' copy almost. What software did you make your project in?

Chris
Amazing!!!
This is so bloody cool!!!
Beautiful! I'm a paper model builder; would you be willing to share the data with me so that I could transform it into paper? Here is some of what I do:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/139506782@N02/albums/with/72157671433855606
Looks perfect in VR!
It could be fun to see an infinite recursion of the painting in the painting ;-)
Awesome idea!
well it looks somewhat interesting but you didn´t actually looked over it realy good. There are some mesh and placementerrors. for example the plate is floating. Also the texturing seems to be a bit clunky. anyway keep it going you are doing still interesting work.
love your work, this is really cool!

Fantastic work from a fantastic show!   You should do a cycle animation of the brim of her hat, ribbons, and dress blowing in the wind.
Nice, but that animation is click bait. XD

Great texture job.
Thank you guys!!!!!!! :D
gotta love the reverse normals outline trick.
Very appealing, I would totally see this staring a bad guy in Fire Emblem or something. Fabulous
@jtp360 ,  reverse normals outline? what is this sorcery you speak of?
It remembers a bit Super Street Fighter 4 style :) great model / texturing
@Trik, the black outline. It's a duplicate mesh inside out and textured black. It's a neat way to create a manual cell-shaded OUTLINE effect. Turn on the wireframe and zoom in to see what im talking about.
O_o thats neet
Awesome work! I like how his face catches most of the light.
Omg, this is REALLY cool. 
The best painting/texturing  what i ever see :) 
GOOD WORK!!!
You used some tutorial or what ?) Pls tell me, i want to learn how do  that. :D
@jtp360, Great Job! 
I tried to upload like this, but i can't. I duplicated black mesh and flip, but appeared 2-sided texture. how i can look 1-side texture?
Thanks all you guys!!! I am so happy that you like this model!!

go [SETTINGS] > [3D settings] > Materials > FACES RENDERING

Thank you!!! I do it now.
excellent design and execution :)
awesome!   very nice!!

@ribtibs @Gesy Bekeyei Thank you!
@axe163 Thanks!! Maybe I will upload my WIP model later :D
@trigrou @Nicolas Gerard I tried to approach American style,but still looks like Japanese syle that I used to. :P
Excellent work, love the cartoon style! And with less than 10k polys, awesome
truly remarkable texturing
Woow! Very nice work here ToshHsu! I like everything, the concept, 3D modeling and the excellent texture and pose!
Congrats!
@alban Thanks! Actually,It's 4.7k tris.Because I duplicated the model to create outline. :D

Soooo coool!
The head of ??? is a little bit strange
thanks @richardhill @rawrsoft @jessy408 , glad you like my work!

@utsuki thanks for the input, though a little more information would be nice. why do you think it looks strange?
Love this!! Looks great! 

I'm new to 3D so I'm taking some close looks to learn. I was wondering why things like the eyes and japanese fonts on the sign are modeled instead of done in a texture? I'm not even sure I worded that correctly...! Anyways, very inspiring work. Thanks for sharing it!
Magic
wow!

It is so very nice!
this is so cute can you go like my creations if you do comment something cool about you on my page
i love this, when is the bus going to come???????
hi, this is really a nice work, like it very much!can i download it for my assignment purpose?i find it is useful...
Possible to export as .Collada or .blend with textures? I am looking to use it for an AR proposal I am doing for my Girlfriend. Totoro is one of her favorite movies, looking to have Totoro man the Portal just before she walks into a Museum of our life together before I pop the question. I am about 3 models in, none of which will work for me. Hoping you will be y favor in getting a life size Totoro in AR. 

Best,

-Truman

Was the emblem on the right arm a reference to the horde? Also I really like this character and pose, I rarely see characters with such a low center of gravity :D

@inupurin I just look for tutorials from youtube. And honestly, I studied Digital Arts and 3D Animation on a school and made some improvements to what I've learned. Making tutorials would be nice, but there's a lot of stuff you may find all over the net.

I'll just give you a hint: never use any smooth function on modeling. Soften and Set Normal Angle are enough.
@tidusyuna09 I used a lot of mild modifier, the mesh was really bad when applied thanks for the hint. The hardest thing for min is the anime style texture and the shadow
@inupurin For starters try using Surface Shader and when you get used to it go for Phong material and add textures to both color and ambient attributes. As for texture, I use bonus tools for UV mapping on  Maya which can be downloaded on their site. And I really recommend 3DCoat which help me a lot since I too have difficulties when it comes to textures and mapping.
@tidusyuna09 I was looking at your images of your modeling on facebook, your work is very good how do you make these textures solid?
@inupurin textures solid? You mean no distortions on edges and some surface? Like I said never go smooth or subdivision smooth preview or Key3. I just go to Mesh Display> Set normal angle = 60-80, set normal angle is like soften and harden but with a controlled value, that's enough to make some areas look better but still low poly. By not using any smooth, putting textures will be accurate without dealing with any distortions specially on UV mapping. Smooth always has pros and cons specially on textures so I never use it. And do quads first then when everything is finished you can change it to tri. 

If it's something to do with the material, just keep playing with those attributes until you get it right. I always prefer Phong since it's commonly used in gaming and has well enough attributes.
Hey,

I love the model you created and I have a question regarding this. Do you do commissioning for items? I have been looking for a 3d obj of the horns for a friend's cosplay and I have had no luck with finding them. Is there a way I could get the horns so I could print it? Of course I am willing to pay for them. Look forward to hearing from you!
great job! how about Lucoa? :)
@l33tm0us3  sure thing I can do that. I just have to finish some of what I'm working right now. Just be patient.
Great model ;)

Is this model single surface? I don't know if this is the right therm... I'm a papercrafter, I need models without interlocked parts that have a single surface to use pepakura to make it into a 2D pattern.
Is there a way I can still download this model?
@Will.Repko I can change it but on a price. And keep in mind this a very old model and not rigged.
@tidusyuna09 I was looking mostly for a 3d model that i can convert and print on my 3d printer (SLA printer not FDM)
Hiya,

I'm aware this is a old model but would i still be able to purchase this?-

I download it. I'm going to use it on VRChat. I hope I can learn how to make the galaxy outfit.

Wow!
Thank you! @flioink @iliedom @The_Newbie
Well done. That's a staff pick!
Awesome @bartv Thank you!
wow, this is the most bad ass model Ive ever seen in sketchfab. great job.
This thing absolutely amazingly amazing amazes me! How was it done? Is it photogrammetry? How have you captured the microsurface so precisely?
No words, great scanning, I can't even imaging how you did to get all the details with that precision
Thanks a lot! @pepawuzhere
@mookan @decoright  Thank you very much! Yes, it is photogrammetry. Here is a short clip showing the scanning process. https://youtu.be/2w74H3o3YF0 About 1.900 images were then processed in Reality Capture to create the 3D model you see here.

Incredible work!
Thank you! @Petro.Stepaniuk
Great work! quick note, annotation 10 doesn't fit on the screen in normal view. I have to put it into full screen mode to view the whole text.
I love it, great work! can I use it for a scene?
@franoroman Indeed you can! And if you want, please share your project with us!
@TheRoyalArmoury Thanks a lot! will do!
Very nice!! Well done!
Absolute badassery, can it be used in a videogame?

I just discovered this site and your work...beautiful
Awesome animation and model!
Reminds me about No Man's Sky
@Ali_Army107 Thanks :)
Great game, I hate the hate hype about it.
All those haters will buy it again one day lol.
@dennish2010 I know they have already decided to return to play since the updates.
it is super good work
Thanks, awesome animation and model.
@Ali_Army107 :D

thank you n.n
It doesn't have any ailerons, though you don't necessarily need them either. It's a combat aircraft, and you can knife for lateral control.
@FierceSavitar Something tells me that it wouldn't quite fit in Robblox art style wise.
@Peekofwar give it a try! Robblox it, whatever this is!

amazing!
Amazing work! Will use this in a short scene ?

It's a great mysterious archer.. the only thing that bothers me are the eyes and the mouth of the mask. You made the opening to small, compared to the concept. I mean you're free to interpret the concept the way you like it .. but I think if you would make the eyes and the mouth opening like in the concept and  paint/bake a shadow from the hood over the forehead it would me a lot better! Nice work! Always happy to see new great stuff from you!
cool! very nice idea
What a beautiful comment, thank you, @samsake ! Yes, you are right. I plane to make some update to this model with a time - I have some list of ideas how to improve it. Sometimes I see weak spots a after a week or even later ))

ha, nice move on those patterns there. Ain't nobody got time for edge loops or texture sheets!, just stick some quads on there and call it a day. Great model.
My God, your work is astounding. Entire gallery is just stellar!
@dopepope thanks a lot ^_^ I am very pleased that you liked my art
Artella featured this scene in their introduction video! Congrats, it truly deserves it!

@redshell hey!, it's awesome, what tools do you use?
Thanks ? @lacinemethi
@zemil I used Zbrush and Substance painter.

Hi Romain, such a great Devil Mask I have been searching for. I test use it for my AR USDZ with Apple Reality Composer:

Hi Romain i want to know if is possible to export the mask to .tsl or another extension supported by autodesk inventor?

Used it - https://sketchfab.com/models/61dc6b33e20f4543b75f1b259280fcfd Also credited your base mesh. Thanks again!
If i were to use as a base and build a shell over it, does that shell count as mine or nah?
@ArgosPan The model is under the license Creative Common Attribution you can found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

If build shell pieces (Armor, clothes or related I suppose) they count as yours. If you redistribute them with this base mesh you must credit the creator of the base mesh. If you distribute only your shell piece none credit must be given, but it would be kind to credit the base mesh anyway.
How bout if the shell is a basemesh but i use yours as a guideline/reference? does that still count?
@ArgosPan You are completely free to use it it as reference, the right on the shell belongs to you as I understand the CC license.

If you have doubt, credit the original basemesh and you are fine.
excusme, where can i download it ?
@Fazri.Lim You can find it here https://gumroad.com/l/qSADLc
you are an amazing person. thank you.

Thx for your kind words guys! Glad you like what I do.
Maybe one day we'll create a game in this style :)
it is ice, not crystals, you can see a frozen fountain in the mexican city scene in the switch trailer

and it is called the nintendo switch not the nintendo shift
This is cool! Is there subsurface scattering going on here?
@zeozen I tried to fake it, yeah! Looks like it worked :)
@essimoon I'd say so! Good work!

It was a bit of luck it turned out this way but I love the Sketchfab viewer for that quality!
I really love this cystal hope one day i can make it like this.
Wow, this looks awesome! How were you able you import the particle effects into sketchfab?
@AaronHB Thx! :D I baked them to object-based animation. I actually published a couple of tuts on the Sketchfab blog on how to do this :)
@essimoon Oh sweet, Thx! I'll go check them out.
do u made verything with unity?! Also the particles?!
@HighfiveFuox This model was actually done in Blender and a bit of ZBrush :) Particles were baked in Blender.
But yeah, I did the lighting and composition of the original project in Unity.

One mistake I can see. The Joy-Con Straps should be identical. That is they both have both a plus and a minus.
@Jackalopalen Fixed. Thanks for the heads up!
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!
@seori That's great, thank you!
Hello, as part of a school project I am looking for a stl on the scale of joycon without wrist strap.

What do u use?
Do you know any website from where I can download 3DS emulator? I came across Citra emulator on this webiste https://citra-emu.org/

But it doesn't seem to be working. I tried few more websites like this: https://www.pokemonsunandmoondownload.com/3ds-emulator-download/

But nothing is working. I really want to play pokemon sun on PC using emulator.

Please tell me.

Hi, sorry to bother you. Did you paint the textures in Blender? If so, how did you get the brushes to work (and were did you get them)? I can't find anything anywhere on how to use custom brushes in Blender +___+ Thanks a lot!
@jfml Hi, no, I painted all the textures using Affinity Photo (it's like Photoshop)
@zalefairytale Ah, that's interesting, so you painted on the UV-Textures in AP?
@jfml Yes, I painted over the UVs
I would love to download / buy this for a test. Possible? I love you work and would be interested to hire you. Please D.M me. Keep up the great work.
@imrsvhk I'm sorry but I can't share this scene, it's based on a concept made by someone else, so it would not be right to earn something from it

Wow, very nice. 
How did you achieve this style? I guess it is manually painted, but maybe you used a special shader?
Hello from Russia
Good Texture

How did you do this? health to your hands
Great style, and top notch work!
Is the cross hatching shading hand painted or generated?
Great work, I am just wondering, how you get this done? I never get so brilliant clean textures within sculptris.

The parallax effect on the fur is astonishing !
How did you obtained it ?
I analysed your technique : it looks like the same mesh duplicated in 3 slightly different sizes with an alpha map.
It's brilliant !
@alexeltech Not the creator but that's it in a nutshell, you can use parallax occlusion for a similar effect too
This is Nice again! Your Fur Game is up top!
@alexeltech Please explain this technique more
@FeisalKassim : this is a powerful technique to add fake fur, carpet, hair, foliage, etc... 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_mapping
http://graphics.cs.brown.edu/games/SteepParallax/index.html
How'd  I get a collada (.dae) mesh and a .BVH animation out of this .fbx ?
@deananan The archive should include a .dae file with the animated mesh. there is no .bvh animation. The whole fbx is animated. Not sure to clearly understand here. you can import the dae or fbx files (which are both animated) in your 3rd party 3d software and then do whatever you need to do. Don't hesitate to answer back if I didn't answer correctly to your question.
Hi, this looks super cool, but have you tested in in game engines? Unreal or Unity? Maybe you can share some tests? :)
@ozogonkiem works perfectly on both platforms.

so much thanks for you, guys :) so glad that u like it
Really cool :)
Neat stuff here! I love the paint color you went for on this one! Real good modeling too seeing it's only 25k verts.

Nice work on the materials, the dirt, the rust. Only the peeled paint effect looks a bit weird because of the shiny steel shining so strong. Right under the paint there would be a matte white or gray primer on top of the steel surface. The steel would only be visible if all the paint layers are completely removed (which doesn't happen due to car's age).

Also, there's something weird going on the leaf springs. The UVs don't seem to match.

Anyway, hope you don't mind such nitpicky comment! The asset looks great nonetheless.
@ollitei 
I think you are right about the texture that too shinny and the leaf springs UVs don't seem to match.
Thank you so much for the input, I dont mind at all, in fact I do like constructive comment :)
This is absolutely incredible! It looks like a real car, especially with all the settings you've tweaked. Well done!
thanks, @Raushen I'm glad that you like it :)
This is absolutely perfect!!!
As by my pic, i love dodges, and this model doesnt change anything. Good job
its super realistic

@bojidarkn Thanks! 
Keep in mind the original models are not mine though, I'm just the remesher/baker or if you wish (that sounds way more badass), The Collector ;)
Do not hesitate to share if you make cool renders with those!
@norgeotloic Yep, saw all your stuff and remakes. For an enthusiast your work seems pretty professional. 
 
Keep collecting my friend. Feel free to re-mesh anything you like from my scans and I'll make sure to post a screenshot of any renders made with those or the tree pack.
@bojidarkn Thanks for the comment (and the offer) :D
I might actually do some more collections of lowpoly scanned assets, and you seem to have a few nice trees/stumps in your models!
Nice collection, well done, and thnx for sharing, this is indeed very handy for in some renders!
@cie Thank you Casper! 
I indeed found out that such collections were especially useful for quick renders or tests, as they allow to skip the long search/check/download/clean/remesh/bake/export phases! Let me know if you make something nice out of it!
I've featured your work on BlenderNation, enjoy :)

https://www.blendernation.com/2018/05/14/my-favourite-blender-art-on-sketchfab-2018-week-20/
@bartv Thank you for the featuring. Hope people will find it useful!
Thank you for your models. I will use them in my landscapes in the Bryce program. As Bryce does not understand this version of the FBX file, I converted them to OBJ. Bryce also could not read texture files (JPEG). This time I just removed the letter e from the extension.
Some textures have numbers 44, 46, although all the objects and textures 42. But I fixed it.
@slepalex You are more than welcome, and thanks for the feedback.

I am indeed thinking about working on my export phase in the future as I am still in the phase of working on my workflow for such assets:
1 - add multiple file formats, .obj and .fbx at least, maybe the .blend also, as the geometries are quite light it should be OK for download size.
2 - maybe add different images resolution (512 - 1024 and 2048, but this would become problematic for the download size...) and why not poly count (for such objects like 150 - 500 - 2000 why not?)
3 - maybe rename the .jpeg to .jpg ;)
4 - I indeed had more than 42 objects in my original scene, but some did not came out as I expected. I removed them but did not change the numbering, thanks for pointing that out!

Do not hesitate to share a screenshot if you make something nice looking, and happy Brycing to you!
@norgeotloic Thanks for the answer! If you want to look at my work, then this is here:
https://www.daz3d.com/gallery/users/8075
https://slepalex.deviantart.com/gallery/
@slepalex Those are some really nice renders you've got there!
I did not know Bryce, but might need to take a look... If only days were 48 hours long ;)
Keep up the good work, I'm glad that some of my assets can be useful to you!
@norgeotloic 1. Any 3D program understands the OBJ and 3ds files.
2. I do not think that you need to add several permissions to the texture for uploading, as this will create problems for loading. Any large resolution can be reduced without problems in any viewer or in a graphics editor.
Awesome!
Hello @norgeotloic 
I used your Low Poly Rock Set for assets for a MOD. I ajusted and created even more lowpoly version to use as LOD for the game engine.  Thanks for your cool work and if you want check out how i used them for a game called Transport Fever. I did mention you and the other contributers in credits. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1621703615
@swissch Thanks for the extensive credits, it's really appreciated !
I just had a look at the steam page, and your mod's users seem to really appreciate our/your work, so although I have no idea about this game, congratulation on what seems to be a nice work ;)
A good way to document typologies. Archaeologists should get inspiration from your work. Congrats!
Thank you so much for this
nice collections! thank you!
I want to know the size of this 3Dmodel (volume or Particle size)
Can you tell me if you understand?
any tutorial or support on how to load the model and texture togheter in blender?
Great job! the texture is excellent! please check your email Luic.
Thank you SO SO SO SO much

I like to view this in my GearVR with sketchfab app. When will be possible? :)
@relax I'm not sure about the sketchfab app but you can normally view this in VR mode using your mobile phone and the VR gear.
@anujhk thats will not be in low persistence mode and not use gearvr's gyro..
@relax soon :) we're working on a mobile app that will let you browse all models.
@bartv best news in 2017 so far :)
Wow!! That is amazing. Congratulations.
Suggestion: It would be great if you made the walls renderable just from the inside, so we can actually see the whole thing from a further point of view.
Just dropping by to let you know that we loved this so much, we posted it on our social! Hope this brought others who love it as much as we do!
@danielperezdominguez Yes I'll keep that in mind for the next upload.. Thanks..
@seori That's great. Thank you soo much!
Hey, love your work. Was just wondering will you be able to help in a project I'm working on? Also what is the best way to contact you, if yes.

Thank You Very Much , Imported Perfectly to My Blender.

i like the geometry on the droid and helmet.. excellent
Could you make me a character of a lil boy like this please? (With FBX/OBJ download)
lol  is bad
@dylantrooper4  Is your criticism going to be constructive in anyway?
The reason why I've been loving this Low-Poly models is cause of the all the Android games that use this niche, acute, isometric Graphics that are clean, simple and feel like it would make for awesome game.
Imagine taking this models and making a Star Wars KOTOR3 for Mobile like Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition.
Nice job on these. 
I have a question though, when you make low poly style models, do you usually soften edges or do you leave them hardened?
null

I have a problem when the importation of the characters are incomplete, could you reupload the characters in unique ways (ie reuplod Rey only, then another folder with only Poe etc ... otherwise it's beautiful. And if you know how to fix this bug tell me how to do it.

@zzshaftzz This model used 106 photos. As to the shape of the mesh, I'm not sure that I entirely understand your question, but suspect that I don't have an answer. The dress had been in a box for a long time, which contributed to its wrinkliness and boxiness. Is that what you mean?
Congrats! Very impressive work, would you mind to share what software and photo rig you used to scan? I am looking to start a freelance business and I am thinking to offer this kind of work to fashion designers.
TIA
Thanks, @eliut! I use Agisoft PhotoScan and a Canon EOS 30D.
Thanks! 
What lens are you using? The kit lens? 18-55 or a 50mm? I guess that a wide angle lens would not be advisable because of distortion. 
Again nice work!
@eliut I use a 50mm. If I had a smaller space to work in, I would probably use the 18-55.
Great stuff Abby, you've captured the texture of the dresses really well.

how you can get that cel shading look? i wanted to do on my May(pokemon), but dont even know how to start =/. Congrats! Nice model!
@raphaelhatencia Thank you!!! I'm using 3dsmax and what I did was I adjust global lighting level to 0,changed viewport's rendering level to consistent color,then you'll see the model won't effected by the global lighting.When you upload it,make sure your shading mode is shadeless. About the line drawing on the model,I just copied the model and inflated it a little bit and flip normal.
Nice Will ! Seams to be easy, i don´t use 3ds but i´ll try that =D thanks a lot

Okay to be honest, this things is pretty friggin terrifying. Its worm-like body is definitely promising and gives me the jeebies.

@strae @rey13 Thanks!
Nicely done, staff pick.
Beautiful
Wow, you've reached 22,000 followers ? Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@nehon @mage Thanks!

@bartv Thanks for the tip! https://skfb.ly/6wEw7
Simple & poetic ! Great work !
amazing *---------*
Simply Devine. Thank You!.
nice texturing method !
It is very strange art, and only two maps, which can not create the imagination .... Good work!
good work!!!
Excellent bit of work love the overall feel of the scene. Almost like a watercolour.
Your scene setup is so cool, simple but effective ^^
I like birds too!

my first likes of sketchfab is really earned it!

Thank you very much :)
Impressive! I'm looking forward to your future work already :)

Which programs did you used?
Thanks a lot guys!! I used mainly zbrush, max, and substance painter
Very Impressive!
We recommended your work for this week's Sketchfab roundup on IAMAG:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-52/

Enjoy! :)
killer work.
Ilove it
Thank you very much guys!! and thank so much Bart, it's a great honor bro :) feeling so good right now man!!
fantastic! I want a toy based on this design XD
Thanks Christian!! I want one too :)
I'm sure this is doable w/ 3D printing Juan :)
plenty of room in the upper body for joints.. not so much in the legs though

Of course even a miniature based on this would be awesome, though he'd need a staff or something to give extra support for the model.
Phenomenal - just saw your other incredible work over at Artstation - would love to see more on Sketchfab! ;-)
Holy crap, this looks so damn cool.
Thank you so much guys!! :)

It's awesome, but I think the shadows could benefit from a little tweak in their 'bias' value:

https://blog.sketchfab.com/8-tips-improving-shadows-sketchfab/
@bartv Thanks Bart, as promised I posted a new model :p
I tweaked the shadow bias as you said, you're right it looks much better, thanks for the tip
I agree with @bartv 
Also, imo the UV map could use a little more back end sync.
Other than that, great job !
@geikogeiko that's because I'm a bit out of sync lately
Nice, staff-picking it!

There is a visible seam on the middle of the face, when unzoomed.
The easy solution to make it disappear is to switch to bilinear filtering for the diffuse channel (skfb editor).
Otherwise, you should avoid uv seams in the middle of the face.
beautiful.
Beautiful work.
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!
I like how you got the texture of the brush strokes on the normal maps too. Makes it look like a 3D gouache painting.

For the wheels, do you model the tire tread and then bake it to the low poly, or just texture it outright without modeling? Just curious thanks.
@stevenb the tire tread is modeled and then baked onto the lowpoly, I find the bend modifier useful for tires :3
@Renafox Thanks. I'm not sure blender has the same type of bend modifier as 3ds max, but I'll look into it.
Nice work.
this model is very good! Thank you!)
how do you get that floor shadow?
Great job!
this truck is a 1950 Chevy. I'm not sure of the model though.

Absolutely amazing job! How did you get that rusty structure??
This has been remade: https://skfb.ly/YsrH
making a nice scene just for this car and another one.
JUST AWESOME
This is awesome!  Would you be interested in offering it as embedded content with 3D software?  We could really use something like this.
Super Cool !
Christine ! Lol Nice job ( .obj format available ? )
I would be really happy to use this car as a prop in a Steam VR environment I'm creating (free). Could I use it, and how could I give you proper credit?
Christine!
thanks, beautifull work
Terrific model Renafox, thank you!
Awesome
got it some time ago. just found it. figured it's a mash of models. a diplomat front with a fireflite sideline. well... loosely based.

Hey! 
The GITF is 53mb big and the limit for non pro users is 50mb :c I'll try to manage the other file which works but maybe it's better for other users to somehow reduce the size c:

@happy32x Thanks!
Hey, I added the category Art & Abstract, and I removed the categories Characters & Creatures and  Cultural Heritage & History. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
I love that you created a story for the Scream.
@doneil The animation/story is based on Munch's diary on January 22nd, 1892.
Removed the annotation and switched to limit the camera to improve the viewing experience.
Let's Have Munch! Really Unreal! King Of The Hill! Top Of The Heap! This, Your Klimt, Vermeer, Damn!

Is there any chance for this to be downloadable? I've seen a few people with it in VRChat and I finally found the source so I was wondering how is this obtained? Thanks beforehand!
@Rhaonoa Hi! I'm sorry to say that this is an avatar I sell commercially within second life, and cannot be downloaded or used elsewhere. If you saw it in VRChat, that saddens me greatly, as the model then has been stolen and used without my consent. :(
@kampfisken  Just wanted to say you did an awesome job. I know a lot of artists that wont upload things to SL or the like anymore for just such reasons. Sorry this occurred for you.
hello there my name is hisador and I am a soft-more in high school and i really really want to pursue the career that is 3d modeling and  I was wondering if  You are willing to please let me have a copy of one of your sergal models  so I could use it as a studying material for my final  and also so I could study the many different ways and textures that go into making these absolutely wonderful creations of yours and yes I do acknowledge that you sell these commercially within second-life but it would be a great learning tool for me and  I personal hope we can work something out so that it can benefit the both of us if you want to contact me my email is hisador.abramovitz@gmail.com
thank you for both your time and consideration and I really hope we can work something out.
hi kamp fisken is it ok if I use your model for a 3d / animated wallpaper pls email me file @ gamescoollolbrofist@gmail.com thank you this model will be used for personal use

I love that model so much! can you send me the file on my email (lilydragon144@gmail.com) please ::3
Hoy if you're wanting to talk about the model that's rolling around VRC I'd like to get in touch with you. I'm not sure if there's a DM system on Sketchfab.
@sergallysergal Not sure what there is to talk about - I do not condone it, and consider it abuse of my public devkit, but there's not really anything I can do about it. I don't have the time or resources to pursue DMCA claims every time something like that pops up. :X
@kampfisken It's not really about DMCA things or anything like that, though I do wanna talk to you about VRC stuff. You happen to have a discord?
Omg this is beyond amazing
Why is this avater not public?

I love that anime style modeling, I'm a prop person, but I really wanna study this one sometime, good job <3
Nice work! I like the anime style, good approach to the paint style texture on the model. Really love it!
Working with textures is excellent, you can immediately see that you are an artist.
Work with topology is terrible. A lot of extra polygons that do not form any form. The mouth area contains a bunch of broken loops. 77 thousand for such a model is 10 times more than necessary.
Look at the work of other people in this style and see that there are models that look the same but at the same time the number of polygons is 5 thousand.
I read that you want to use this model in the game? It is not surprising then that the games that should not slow down, slow down on a pretty good PC!
Topology is not suitable for animation completely. Just look at the bend in the elbow.
So awesome dude great stuff!
could I please get a download for this model
Awesome!

I'd like to run around this Hyrule.
I love this so much.  is there any special method you used to get all the measurements right?
I love it! The detail is amazing and I laughed as I saw this. However this laughter of mine was laugh of joy as I saw how lovely it is. Simply you have done wonderful and very amazing job on it. Keep it up. I can't wait to see more from you.
@Severi thanks for the kind words!! :)
@kaighen as a base, I used the 2D original pixel art that I adapted a bit in photoshop. Then used it as a flat plane at the bottom of my 3D model!
very great job
Perfect!
I based my first model uploaded to this site on your Link's model. Great job.
This looks so cute. Well done!

It might just be my phone, but the run cycle doesn't loop fluently at all. It looks like there are some extra frames that aren't supposed to be there (when both front paws are on the ground)
So beautiful <3

@bohuntn12 

Hello bohuntn12. This was created using Photoscan. I took around 70 pictures of a deer skull from different angles, ran them through Photoscan to create a rough 3d model, and then cleaned it up in zbrush.
Is this able to be downloaded?
I to would appreciate a downloadable model!

@bartv Nice ! :)
I love it. Very good work :)
Very nice model, bravo! Just a small tip: I'd try decreasing angle of view to avoy distorsion, expecially during rotation.
@geoinformatico Thanks for the tip ! I also added a little bit of sharpness in post-processing.
Thank you so much, model used in this demo video:

Been looking around for a good Toothless model; this surpasses all of the downloadable ones I've seen by far. Love the detail - especially in the wings (The ribbing between the wing membrane parts is what all the ones I've so far seen have been missing). Also, it seems to be pre-accident. Nice!
Now I just have to learn how to use Unity properly... ;)
no offence but its missing its middle fins but love it :D

Does this model include retractable teeth?

This artifact does not appear to be Native American to me. It is very weathered but the rounded eyes and prominent nasal features indicates possible African ties, possibly brought over from Africa centuries ago. If not African, could have some evidence of South American cultures making their way to the Carolina region but I think there is a reason it is baffling to local historians: it traveled from far away and was abandoned, purposely or accidentally.
Reminds me of Anglo Saxon and Viking Martial figure Carvings. Same features.

Very cool presentation.
Genius!! I like so much the lighting. How did you put together the two panoramas?
null
@abielmuren
First, you need to set your game res to a square. Then set the ingame fov to 90 degrees. Then use teleport command to teleport yourself to face exactly center of the six directions (front, back, left, right, up, down) and take a screenshot for each angle with the shaders turned on. Now you got yourself a cubemap. Then you could just use any panorama converter on the web to convert/stitch it to whatever format you want. You would also want to photoshop out some seams or errors after it's converted.
That technique definitely gives great result, Staff Pick !
Until I read the description and saw that this was a panoramic image rather than a fixed viewpoint of a 3D model, I hadn't noticed, great work!
The composition of the scene is also fab, as is the scene itself :D
@patrix Thank you very much for your replay! I will try to something similar! :D
Soooo this is just a picture? I'm confused. Whatever it is it looks like witchcraft to me!
Letting you know this was featured on IAMAG's Sketchfab Realtime Selection! 

https://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-106/
Wooow thats amazing!
what mod did you use to make the 360 images_
@TechnoCraft I didn't use any mod for the panorama, you can scroll down to see my reply to another person
how did you pause minecraft to make the clouds paused?
@TechnoCraft I didn't pause the clouds and water waves, that's why I used photoshop to cleanup the seams after it's converted to a panorama

Great 3D model.
Very nice, can you show a max res texture scan please?
Hi @public-art.uk ,

This particular model has 4096 x 4096 texture which is rather typical for texture mapping of objects of that size. Unfortunately we have not kept the source files to re-apply the texture on this particular model.

The maximum texture size that Artec Studio can provide for texture mapping is 16 384 x 16 384. We can apply texture of this size on another model and share it with you. Is it suitable?

Just added to my collection of unique and unusual models. My only presentation suggestion would be to update the rotation angle to have the head be straight and not biased when you face it.
@alban Yes, good point! Is this better?
@morethanadodo Ah yes much better! Except that now the initial view point  is the back of the head, you may want to save a new one
@alban Thanks - think I've fixed that. Still getting to grips with Sketchfab!
Fantastic scan! Any chance of making the file downloadable? Or future plans on scanning the dodo foot Oxford also has?
Pode fornecer o arquivo para download por favor? Sou professor na Universidade de Sao Paulo e este espécime é muito importante para as aulas de extinções e anatomia.
@Literary_Octopus Thanks - glad you like the model. We don't have any further scanning plans at the moment, but watch this space. We're currently only sharing the model through Sketchfab rather than making it a downloadable file.
@morethanadodo I understand. Thanks anyway, for uploading it at all.
Just an aside, in case you haven’t seen yet, the The La Rochelle natural history museum shared their nearly complete dodo skeleton: https://sketchfab.com/models/264b7746a42b41b2845a499de16f8538

It is absolutely amazing.

Thanks again.

crazy but fantastic!
Is this for the deepwater Lost River? If so, aren't green algae are excess here? On the Earth green algae are never so deepwater, in the Subnautica world i also don't remember green plants so deep.
Love the amount of detail in the skull, more so the little hidden Exosuit drilling into the rear of it.  LOL.  Good use of scale though.  Look forward to enjoying this in the game.
This looks awesome. Very Crocodilian or Spinosaurid. 
I do wonder though, is/was the creature capable of closing its mouth? It's jaws seem fused together. And, how did it swallow whatever it nommed on?
Congrats! We picked your model to feature this week: http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-54/
Im just glad its dead :D
Wow, that is some huuuge skull.

I wonder what it looked like when it was alive.
It would be great to have a little backstory with these models. Like with this one I'd love to read what the blue patches are and why they haven't faded. I love the little detail of the Mech by the way ;-)
Bart, I bet the blue patches are barnacles of some kind

So is this a Sea Dragon's skull? both have 2 sets of eyes (third hole is for ears I think), but the front teeth are alot different than your model here :https://sketchfab.com/models/b5b7d80310464f87b1123c84a9afe862

amazing regardless
@tacticalhog It's not a Sea Dragon skull, the Sea Dragon does not have those huge canines at the front.
@tacticalhog Also the Sea Dragon does not have horns.
@ungaybrony from the scale of the Exosuit I reckon the male character is probably a little over the height of the back eye socket.
@jack14curtis huh, then i wonder what its from
null
the full cyclops can fit in there so it could probably one bite a reefback seadragon reaper and maybe a ses emporor
@rattiousgaming2.0 it can fit the cyclops in the mouth so its that big

@OlegGee like hell if i know :D i almost finished this one with ~15k tris with all textures and stuff then decided to remake all of this, and did it one more time in ~6k, so i can't tell how much time i spent.
similar situations sometimes happen with me too)))
Whoaaaa! I cannot believe the amount of detail you could put on such a low-poly model! Truly amazing, kudos! :D
@imansatriaputrasukarno  Thanks! :)

How did you do the texture? I'm working on a flightsim and need terrain! Please help :3
Thank you Krzysztof for the terrain. I will write more, when I have found out if I can upload it as a terrain in one of my regions in the Arcana micro grid. Thanks again, that you allow me to use it :)

Look Gorgeous, nice and clean, only thing i'd say is how the 2'd hologram on the side connects with the lights at the base/beginning could do with maybe some kind of fade instead of being so sharp, or try to blend it more or something. Good work!!!

The model looks simply amazing. Can I ask how do you create those carved lines along the model? Do you carve them in the high poly model by using some kind of knife tool? (knife tool is from Blender 3D, I don't know if it has the same name in other programs)
Haha its much simpler than that, they were drawn on in Substance Painter XD
Damn dude. This asset looks better than what is actually used in a halo game.
This is so so clean...=O you did an amazing job ! well done !
OMG wow!!
wow this is amazing good job man!!
dis is cool i give it 100/10
Whaouuuuu, incredible yours the best I hope do model as you ^^

Hi there Victor, Maybe you saw my post on the Sketchfab forum about our up-coming London Sketchfab meetup. It would be great if you could make it. It’s on the 25th, between 6 and 9.30. The venue is near IKEA on the North Circular and adjacent to Stonebridge Park tube and overground station. It would be great to see you there if you can manage it. Andy

Cool speed model. I would double-check that rear top edge, it's supposed to be completely planar/flat and I detect a point/angle shift right above the back of the rear door. A tricky model to nail since it leaves little room for error with all those clean slices. Keep up the good work.
@jtp360 Oh yes u're right, I think I accidetnly deleted one edge there, will fix in couple hours ? Thanks, good catch
damn, so many teslas these days, but nobody was able to make proper interior...
null
@transistor It's comming ? stay tuned!
Amazing model! The rear-wheel arch is a bit off though
Finally accurate one, was looking everywhere! Thanks
@sleepyjoshua Just fixed it ? Hope it's better now
@Malwina.Malwa.Kowalewska Thank You :)
TOP stuff!
@sleepyjoshua Thanks, should be fixed now :)
@bubelrobert Looks better! :D
So many tris for low poly :D
The interior is very low poly.

Genial!
great Im modeling just right now horse skeleton and this is so helpful, I got it almost all ready but pelvis is hell when its about to model it :/ I know in sculpt mode would be easier but I dont have now digital pad so it would be as hard. Thanks for this sculpture its great to study how those bones works :D
@MatBaranowski 
Hey, Sorry for the late reply. please shere the link with me if you upload it somewhere when you finish. I strugled to  model pelvis as it is quite different from human And took me a while to understand how it goes.
null
@diegoluga  Hey Diego, generally speaking I modeled it somehow, but its far from perfect, fortunately in a scene that I made the horse skeleton for, the pelvis isn't visible, here is the final result, it was for Weekly CG challange 106 The living dead, I have whole skeleton, if you want I can do full body render and show you also :) 

https://stormhussar.deviantart.com/art/Rider-s-Awakening-698763257
@diegoluga original scale is 1920x1080 but on deviantart I set it to smaller size :)
Tha'ts awesome! Wish I could rig that and animate it :) Espcially hooked up to some old Ghostly Wagon.
Would you happen to know what type of horse it was?
Also, were some parts missing, if so, which ones?

Thanks for sharing
Good model, Thank you!
Diego, Thanks for making this horse skeleton available. I think there are a couple of bones which are out of place. I'm pretty sure that the two bones projecting behind the front knees labeled Group6787 and Group6652 are actually the Sesamoid (fetlock) bones. See the anatomy drawing at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Horse_anatomy.svg
for their placement.

Do you know if anyone has rigged the skeleton so it could be animated?

Drew
Many Thanks!
Thanks a lot for this!  This is great work, its sure to help me out in my animal anatomy studies. :)
Thanks you!!!
Hey Diego, That's a great piece of work, thanks for sharing it with us. trying to work out a sculpture idea which is complex enough for sure - but made much easier to visualize with this great model. 
Will credit you for sure.
Thank a thousand time Diego that is very rare people sharing high quality model like you do!

Hi, I need any one to help me and support in my graduation project plzz, my email alshibanyahmed7@gmail.com , & Thanks.
is it a model of real terrain or just an artistic work?
Excellent work, is there's any possibility to have copy?
@jumpjack we downloaded the 3D terrain of the actual moon landing that can be found on the NASA web page. The texturing of the surface of the moon with the footprints are referenced from moon footage from NASA and then artistically generated.
Hay posibilidad de tener una copia para llevarlo a holograma y ensenarlo a mis estudiantes, agradezco me confirme
Nice!  I can't wait to check it out with a vr headset!

Have these been unwrapped yet?
@Ali6 No, because my character pack can  interchangeable hands and feet, so no unwrapped.
Can it be used on Maya?
@alpha1178 I'm sorry, the rig for blender only, but the base model(FBX,Obj) can use by other 3D software.
@redy would you consider these to be pretty easy fixes

are all of the models rigged or only the 3 on the left?
@CalvinCoolridge All rigged
will you be coming out with more of these model sets ?
@CalvinCoolridge  If I have any new idea for the meshes, I will add-on, but the price also will slightly increase.
@menglow i mean youve made child meshes, these meshes, hand meshes, im wondering if youll keep on making more products like these

if you download a the sfm file. just decompile the model with Crowbar compiler, import SMD file into 3D modelling software and do whatever you can to make it printable.

this is awesome!! but please fix the geometry on the point of the sword, it´s a little broken
@alexcres yeee. there are a lot of problems here - this was one of my first models and there are a lot of mistakes here . Don't know why anybody like it :D
@leoluch naah man, it´s just a little detail to polish ;D
I've noticed that there is a slight texture error on the right side on one of the notches towards the point. Still looks great. Will it be downloadable at some point?
i would like to download it for my Unreal Engine game which i will publish next year. I will acknowledge you and give you credit if you would let me download it. Thank you

Nice work *o*
Love the textures and detail on the dress and jewelry. She even has wear marks on the bottom of her shoes! The hair with the curled ends is elegant. Beautiful work as usual Dmitry!
She's amazing! really great detail, and beautiful texture work! 

Staff pick material for sure!
Dmitry is back with another masterpiece!
Welcome back Dmirtry! I love her pose and clothes. It's a staff pick :)
I *need* her shoes! She's really lovely. I think her legs and hands are so well done, and I love that you went for a more demure bra size compared to the usual female art. I do think her shoulders are maybe too wide, or round. It makes her torso seem too thin. Or maybe her torso needs to be wider, I don't know. Still much better then anything I could sculpt :p
Oh I'll have to try out the transparency dithered hair on sketchfab, at first I didn't like it, but you 3D geniuses have made it work so well! As always, great work Dimitriy! :D
She is so pretty!
Well done....
very nice, but the render is too dark for me ...
That is really good, it looks amazing. I love her outfit, and the way her face is shaped. Very creative.
Thank you so much guys for your comments! Thank you!
And thank you @bartv for the Staff Pick! Super happy YAY! :D
Good job !
Incredible work!
The hair is blowing my mind! It's transparent shells right?
Awesome, like it so much.
Thank you guys!
@Tepuitrouble yup.
Using an image for eye twinkle & depth was a nice touch.

Amazing job dude :D
Just thought I'd let you know that I saw your work on BlenderNation and thought it was excellent.  Have been trying to emulate with limited success.  Just started on here and don't really know enough about Blender and textures yet but your stuff is excellent and inspirational.  My attempts at basically copying your work (using a more convoluted workflow as I'm stuck with QGIS and GRASS for my processing) can be seen here:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/lazlowoodbine/
Many thank for the inspiration and the tutorial!!
Thanks very much. The Yewbarrow models look great!
Very impressive and beautiful 3D work! Congrats @opowell!
Que buen trabajo, saludos
This is very impressive. I am wondering if I can give you a project exactly the same to be done for my company. Instead of buildings I have one drill machine and 30 drill holes that I want to show on our website.

I just want to have the ability to turn off and on some numbers on screen.

My email is farshad@terracad.com.

Where can I contact you for comissions?
@etiolate Thank you c:
@CerebralCrisis This commissioned model belongs to the commissioner only c:
@switzyfranze Just updated my profile info :) I'm currently closed, though :(
@zcythe No, it arguably doesn't belong to the commissioner. Don't put it this way. They didn't make it. Nothing of this is self made. The only pieces i don't recognize from SL are the textures for the T-Shirt... Its a pretty good translation tho! I have no idea how to do that. |D
@liliofthemountain This model and textures were made entirely from scratch by me. These files belong to me and to the one who paid for it. The character being similar to others is another story.
@zcythe Huh. If you say so then thats how it is! Looks good regardless!
@liliofthemountain Thank you c:
This is beautiful. When will you open commissions again?
@missionfuzzy Thanks! It might be a while before I'm open again. Not until next year, most likely.
@zcythe Alright. I'll make sure to keep an eye out. I'd love to commission you. ^^
Your stuff is so badass i legit love you
@trashlizard Haha thanks :) And you sir deserve more followers. Love your toon style.
@zcythe thank you so much!! i've been focusing this summer on improving fast, one day i hope to make models as complex and cool as your ones:)

@zaxtrong2.gaming hmm I will say no if this is a commission so do you need to ask the person who has ask for this commission to be make
can i have a commission of this only with completely different textures? If your open. Or could I have the model file possibly? Thank you!
could I get a dl please

This is sweet man. Sadly I can't obtain this. I'd like to use it but it's yours and I respect that. Hope you continue with your creations.

Capability whether the corrected surface texture applied again? I corrected the surface of your model, but without the texture. Best wishes for the work.
You cannot correct the surface without loosing the surface texture. This is a technical problem neither link to 3D scanning, Memento 3D or sketchfab. This is due because by modifying the model, you loose the UVmap created for the model. And without UVMap, the software cannot applied the surface texture anymore. To correct the surface without loosing the texture surface you might look on specific forum.
By using Memento beta, I know this software is capable in some extend to modify model without loosing the surface texture. However, this does not work all the time, and I had a lot of problem to import the mesh afterwards.
It is a pity. There would be a qualitative model. thanks for a complete answer.
very sorry for the poor quality of my free 3D scan. Please, would you like send me a link where you could find better, I am looking forward for that too.
Quality is very, very decent, especially liked the model Baronesse Sipiere.
great scan Geoffrey !
Thanks you very much!
Thanks you very much!
I love how dramatic is the difference between the two thighs - the great swelling of the supporting leg and the very relaxed right leg. Thanks for sharing.
very great
Thanks you very much @soydan_2003 

@scottbreton thanks for the comment. I have never paid attention to that but you right. Now, the 3D scan is not totally accurate. However we can see a difference between the two legs.
Excelent Geoffrey!!
@juanherrera Thanks you! Appreciated!
Geoffrey, very nice model! Bravo
@antognom Thanks you!
Hello, my name is Giuseppe Dromedari I'm Italian, I'm also a fan of scans and 3d graphics, I know Rhinoceros and Memento for photogrammetry quite well, but I do not know how to decimate 3D models. You could recommend me some softwares or valid methods.
Thank you
@evolution Thanks for your post! Unfortunately, I am just using the decimate button on AutoDesk ReCap Pro. Otherwise, you may try Simplygon or Instant Meshes.
Thank you very much. Very cool!

Interesting 3D Model, I adore the way you managed to make her representative, considering the fact that it's powerful.

Terrific work. I like all of the Pilatus aircraft. Interesting that none have wheel well covers. They must have made a drag/weight analysis and determined covers were not really needed. Pilatus is introducing their first business class jet this year. Do you have any plans on designing other Pilatus models? They have scale drawings for modelers on their website.
@deadlytedly 

Thank you!
Yes, of course I have plans... but that and when it is not thought )
and get a good drawing is always a big problem...
@tivsol
Link to Pilatus scale model plans = http://www.pilatus-aircraft.com/#161
I had to go to site map to find them. Enjoy!
Hmm, did I forget to actually staff pick it after promising you? Let's fix that!

Hi @tivsol ! Very beautiful work ! Just one remark : Could the textures of the animated nose be blurred as is the helix ?
@YannickDeharo 
if you look closely, then on the cap of screw there are transparent, blurred patches ... to hide the base of the blades ...

to blurred the texture of the cap screw itself - of course you can if necessary ...

in general, the effect of rotation of the screw and the cap - it is required to be tuned for a specific game engine ... so here I made the simplest version.
@tivsol Okay ! I understand. I saw that before, but to be honest that was the details on the normal map which annoyed me. the screws's bumps on the nose break the blurred patches's effect.
Otherwise, very beautiful work again !

the fuzzy background adds so much to this image
how to download?
Once we finish rigging the character the model will be available on Unreal Marketplace and Unity Asset Store.
Hey @digitalshock, I noticed you didn't add any categories or tags to your model. It's an important thing to do so it'll show up in the right galleries, getting your work more exposure! Please consider updating it :)
Updated, thanks for letting me know. Not sure what happen but the tags were there before.
Cool model =)
How many hours did you spend?)
This model was built from concept to final in about 10 working days.
Amazing work ! One of the best texturized character sci-fi models on sketchfab !
this is amazing i hope one day i can make something equally this good
one of the best models.. in deed!
Beautiful!
Great !
Hi, I have been unable to find this on the Unity Asset store so far. Is it out and I missed it, or is it coming any time soon? Looks GREAT! 

Thanks!
Hello, good morning, I really liked the 3d model where I can download it ?
so, he just never made this available?

For a model that came out before the game, this is pretty freaking accurate. Almost as accurate as the models people use now for sfm. Kudos to you m8 but I have 1 question. Is this rigged?
Cool model but can you please make an fbx version?

sorry to say but no shoulders :/

Great job! But why does the mirror not reflect?)
Simply and beautiful ! Great work Renafox, you are very talent !
I really love this. Really nice job!
can I ask where did you get images for texture ? did you took images yourself ?
@nima pedramasl

The textures are entirely made in substance painter
@kryik1023 wow I'm impressed :) great job :)
So is this Maya LT or 3DS Max? I'm a programmer so talentless in the art department but keen to learn.
@dredious It says she used Max in the description. In other words, 3DS Max :D. If you're completely inexperienced with 3D art and want something free, try blender. If you decide you like 3D art, you can always buy one of the commercial products later if you want to. There's plenty of tutorials on youtube to help get you started. Best of luck to you!
Thank you!

@cristianprieto02 thank you!
That's great! I'm staff picking it :)
@bartv awesome! thank you!
great stuff!
@willphase1 Thanks!
Nice! But perhaps a dumb question: is this made with photogrammetry?
@jamesoneill No, it's not photogrammetry. It's modeled by hand with hand painted textures. Check the link above for more images.
@mariusm3d thanks...Koolio stuff...looking forward to your next model!!
very beautiful
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

sorry for the long weird rig,it is actually intended for other posing software.
Well i have to take down the download option as many people are using it without crediting me or the game witcher3 from where the character was taken.

@biswayan could you export it to .fbx??
yes i can export it to fbx
Is there no way to download this model? @biswayan
I am working on cosplay of geralt of rivia is there a way to download the model or you didn't finish it yet?
@fire.dragon170 well i am gonna make it available for download as a lot of people are asking for it :D
The only problem is that people doesnt give CD Projekt credit for this model.
Recently I just noticed that the rigged tag is still there.
I will remove it soon as it is not a rigged model anymore. Sorry for the misunderstanding
Dear sir, do you perhaps have a moel of Dettleff? Thanks.
even tho its a late reply but I don't have a dettleff model yet
Hi man ! Nice 3D model but I don't know how to put texture on it in Unreal Engine
:/ Can you help me ?
Is there a way to get my hands on this with a rig? Wanna make a Wallpaper Engine with that :D
Great work man! I was with some doubts about making a retopology's for my model and your model answered that.
In your opinion, what is the average of tris for models with the complexity of witcher 3 characters?
null
Another one, why did you use bumpmap and no normal map for some pieces?
I'll check the maps, sadly I don't have the original model anymore(my buddy still have it). The avg polycount could be at least 40k-45k or something at least (depending on costumes and dresses).
PS: sorry for the typo error, I am on a phone right now :P
thanks bro your a great artist 
I will use it for my assignment ?
Hi. I downloaded the model but can't make textures appear on it. Can you help please?
Yea, I checked and there is no .mtl file at all. Can I have the file for textures?

@hvalle @authedes  Thanks guys!
Download link please so I can 3D print it?
@mattespinosa Honestly this isn't in a very printable state. A lot of the detail is in the normal maps. It would take a lot of work to get it to print.
Well done modelling Lucina! You should try some shaders if it helps with the lighting! :P

NOICE!!!!
O YIS THANKS @thefuzzyone34 !!!
Folowed! And I never thought someone would make 3D model from that anime. XD
thank you so much for the follow @EdvinBorkovskij ! ohoho then youre in for a suprise because im gonna sculpt Tsuyu Asui( frog girl best girl) after i finish with Uraraka Ochako! :D
this looks great, but if it's for 3D printing there are a lot of areas that may give you trouble/fragility (I'm guessing full color sandstone). Also there's no base for the finished object? (I do really love this series and character btw lol)
OH yeah of course. You're totally right Christian Brock! i havent done a base yet and theres still a lot of things i have to tweak. i do not think i will actually 3D print it but it IS my intention to make it LOOK like it could be 3D printed and give it an anime figurine feel. thanks for the feedback man! i really appreciate it!
I would love to rig and animate this if you have any interest in that ;) Such a fantastic scultpt!
Pleas free obj dowload model
@solimen why should he give away his work for free? Isn't his effort worth something?
Christian Brock If he puts the model free of charge, then he will receive fame from the project and will be contacted by him for models on request
I love this image very much, but I can not find the way to download the file to be able to print it.
thanks @Robert.Johnson, yeah it burns me up when people seem to think that an artist should give away their work for the fame and exposure alone.  While it's important for an artist to get their name out there, it's been my experience that giving away your work for free and taking requests only leads to more people expecting you to work for free.  And that does nothing to pay your bills. People like @solimen seem to think that fame and requests can be used to buy groceries.
Great job! Congratulations: D Is it possible to have the file obj for personal printing. Thank you very much: D
That is just awesome! Nice moves, keep it up!!
cool
@wulongti sadly I think BNHA characters are protected by copyright laws, there could be some pretty big issues if this model is monetized with out proper licensing
@Magzywagzy while that may be true, you could also argue that this falls under fan art and is no different that artists selling prints of copyright characters at cons :)
@wulongti you have a point there however Nintendo have been coming down pretty hard on fan projects, I'm sure many creators would be grumpy at anyone making money off their IP

This guy is really talented and could do well with his own IP and to be fair now that there's a bnha game coming to the switch we might get an ochaco amiibo

Take team four star for examaple, that was fan made and free yet there were still massive legal issues
dude this is amazing ???? like you have so much talent what the hell
could I please get a download for this model

Awesome model. I can see why this was replaced with the current Goliath, but this still has a lot of potential. Just not fitting his theme, could only woprk as a completly new monster .
But nice work indeed

@seori Thank you Seori, glad you liked it !
@cornea Thank you very much! Well it took about 12 days, I'd say.
@Critterrox Thanks :) You could try the first person navigation (in the scene settings). Cheers
@etienne.beschet Merci Etienne ! Oui tu as raison pour le bruit de pas. J'ai fait ça un peu à l'arrache... Je vais les désactiver je crois ! Par contre je garde ta très bonne idée de l'objet animé pour une prochaine scène (en attendant de me mettre à la modélisation de perso, qui, je dois dire, ajouterait beaucoup à mes créations) :)
C'est totalement bluffant. L'ambiance victorienne et apocalyptique (le zeppelin qui plane comme une menace sourde - ce bruit de fond inquiétant...) qui contraste avec le chant des oiseaux, et ces gouttes de pluie lancinantes... Chapeau. C'est très impressionnant et parfaitement réussi.
Fantastique. J'adore le zeppelin
@gerpho Merci beaucoup! Le zeppelin est un ajout de dernière minute ;)
Beau travail comme d'habitude :D ! Dommage pour le sol !
Wow! Just WOW! :)

Thanks guys! 

I was hoping to scan The Thinker by Rodin, but unfortunately, the sculpture was too high for me.
Seen this sculpture in Calais actually. Nice one :)
Awesome, I love Rodin.
Well done, great, you can see between the statues. I downloaded but alas can't open .blend files.
rnvgag: .blend files can be opened by Blender, which is free and available on most platforms. You can convert to obj or any other format with it. See http://www.blender.org/
as it is a very excellent scan I downloaded it , but the blend file miss the texture. Anyways , great work, Maurice.
ps if Le penseur  is too much hight for you , I wonder how you did the Wallace fontain. On the back of a camel ?  best wishes , anyways...
Pretty impressive!
Very nice!
Thank you very much, Maurice.
like!
May remade it for source engine? would like see it in some csgo map
@cheroke98cz sure, go ahead. I'd love to see that :)
hey, are your models 3d printable? if not, may I clean them up and get them ready to be downloaded and printed by users?
@mireiiille I haven't tested the printability, but feel free to clean them up and print them :)
@mireiiille Did you eventually got to cleaning them up for printing?
Great! THx
Belle qualité avec seulement 38 photos...mais important travail de nettoyage pour obtenir quelque chose d'imprimable. Quelqu'un aurait-il déjà effectué ce travail ?...parce que moi je ne suis pas un grand spécialiste de la question et je ne pourrais pas obtenir quelque chose de vraiment propre.
i like
nice model !

Excellent work. I see other Star Citizen ships are downloadable. Will you make any of yours downloadable as well? Would be great for walk through and demos.
@junkaphobia Unfortunately CIG does not want that their models are that easy obtainable. However I can point you in the right direction.

Absolutely outstanding! Well done. :-)
Hey man, really love your work. 
Coul you look at my Dragonair sculpt ? It's not quite as good as your stuff but I'd really like to get your input.
https://sketchfab.com/models/24c1ec5270e94536acddaabaa06a3911
OH MY GOODNESS!!!! How did you do that?!
Hi, i really love the work that you put into this charmander, do you mind if i ask you what software you rigged this in,  and can i possibly use this for an upcoming video on youtube, and class presentation to wow my friends, i would definitely give the credit to you.
hey i have a question about the fire on the tail. Is that a mesh you created?? I was trying to create fire for my Lucario fusion for sketch fab but i used the simulation in blender and not a mesh to make it. If you have any tips id be happy to hear them.
Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

Thank you for sharing such a great scan.
Great scan, and very humorous blog.  For this tree scan you describe using station camera mode.  What is that?
This is one awesome scan. You rarely see a full tree, mostly just stumps.
perfect
That's fabulous!
It looks incredible!  Exactly what I was looking for. Will credit and link you the result :)

Thank you Amanda! ^_^
Wow this is really awesome! You're my new favorite. :)
Amazing work. What's your modeling process?
@elyptic 

This model was created in ZBrush ... I usually use a basic model with good topology, already divided into Polygroup. Once I find the right proportions of the body, and detail, for clothes I prefer extract portion of mesh, than carved with dynamesh, then zmesher for good topology and final details.
For clothes with many folds, I prefer using Marvelous Designe, retouched (and retopo) in ZBrush.
For hair I start from a simple dynamesh.
@dennyd 
Truly incredible.. I want all your models! I'm working on an indie film and she would make an amazing Egyptian Goddess.
its great how you do it? :D
@gunner6084 

Hi gunner

read below, where I explain my workflow in a few words.
She is perfect xD
Hi Denny, is this model available for download or purchase somewhere? She's perfect for one of our characters.
Você pode disponibilizar o download ! <3

This is part of our category refresh, you can read about the update here:                            

https://blog.sketchfab.com/introducing-our-new-categories/                            

And view guidelines for each category here:

Soon we will also limit each existing Sketchfab scene to one category, so pick your category carefully.                            You can use tags to further classify your model.
Super nice work, I love the touch of animation. Staff pick!

PS: did you consider adding some sound?
@bartv woah! thanks!
@paulchambers3d sure, no problem, sounds like a good decision anyway =)
@bartv I wanted to add sound that came out from the headset, but the length of the sound clip is limited to the animation timeline, so i cant put sound with such short loop.
Super nice colour palette and stylised textures, love it!
The paws under the bed are a nice little detail, great cute scene overall!
?????,????
wow...i love it
This scene is so cute! I especially love the animation! It has so many small details like the bouncing hair and the small clouds from the cup of coffee that are in sync with the animation! :D Really adorable <3
thanks!
@AlanYeoh regarding adding sound: actually you can use a longer audio file, but you can't sync it up with the animation anymore.
@bartv i finally saw the checkbox underneath the track, thanks! =)
@curlscurly thank you!! =)
@essimoon thanks! =D
The sound is awesome! ?
This is so cute wow, SO to kk slider

Geoffrey, I have been to the Glyptotek and seen this, thanks for bringing those memories back, and thanks for taking the time to model this lovely statue.
@STXSURVEY Thanks you! The Glyptotek is a fantastic place indeed!
I really love all your models.  I can't wait to use them all. Thanks for sharing.
@rosalioinojosa You are welcome! What kind of project to you plan to use the model?
@geoffreymarchal Very nice scan! (as always) 

Im curious about your workflow shooting The Three Graces. How many pictures did you shoot in total? Pictures /angle? (if multiple angles) Any close ups?

Also, which camera do you use to achieve these results? And which lens?

The geometry of your 3D-Scans are superior to many others. Im impressed, and curious.

Regards

Chris
@geoffreymarchal 
I'd like to use these 3D Scanned statues in neoclassical architectural models. Then I'll use then in iClone or Lumion for real time animations.
@rosalioinojosa Thanks you very much! Looking forward to see the result!
Hi @Pappac,

I am using a simple 16mm lens with a Fuji X-M1. I took about 250 pictures doing several 360 around the sculpture and taking more pictures about some details. A tutorial is supposed to go on-line a SketchFab about my workflow ;).
Hi Geoffrey
Is everything in OBJET format? It has errors and I cant seem to convert to STl  OR G code because the errors can not be fixed by tools3D. I love your work, I am trying to print it. Can you suggest any thing?
@3DTheta Yes, as .obj is the most well spread format for 3D file. I suggest to move to another software. I got no error from Blender, Netfabb, 3DSMax, Maya, and Fusion360 to cite only those one. Further work might be require to 3D print the file. I suggest to keep an eye on my MyMiniFactory account were I regularly post 3D scan ready for 3D print.

wonderful piece for vr, although watching her wait is making me anxious
@bartv Thank you! We added the tag :)

@kdeluxe Thank you! Although we completely forgot about the VR settings.. We've adjusted the size and position now. We don't have any VR equipment, but it must be an interesting experience with this scene.

oh good. You published this recently. so I hope that means you'll see this for I am now obsessed with that color scheme. kinda reminds me of the village Riomaggiore in italy. Those colors on a robot mech is genius though. You sir have my most profound respect.

@squishysbusiness Hello! Unfortunately, since I don't own the original concept, I can't put it out for sale/use, sorry.
I really love how basic the shapes are with the bipedal mech, it's really awesome inspecting it! Amazing job!

We are starting to play with underwater footage (would love to do the acquisition as well..), but since you are specialist in it, did you started to use tools like OpenROV? 

And also which post processing do you use to adjust colours underwater?
I reed some paper but if there is something well known and available, would be nice.

Good job man, they're really nice. Thanks for sharing them <3
Yes, I’m interested. And i wasn’t think that it  last meeting
Anyone get this to work? Doesn't work in C4D, Poseray, or Blender. No faces, no vertices.
Cool! Thanks! ;)
Thank you.
Congratulations on reaching 1000 followers - it's great to see more people discovering your work! 

Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

sketchfab.com/bartv/collections/followers-milestones
So nice thank you.
I manage to make it to work by using Spin 3D. By reconvert it in .obj.Import it in Spin 3D then export it in .obj again .I think it correct the file.Work well in Blender 2.8
.Thank you very nice models.
@Ricardo5721 thanks, Ricardo! don't have enough time to check all issues and compatibility, so such tips are really helpful. thank you. and i hope online converters could serve in such tasks well too.

Bonjour,

Je suis à la recherche de la même animation que j'ai (inspire 1), mais avec l'inspire 2. 
C'est quelque chose que vous êtes capable de faire ?

Voici la vidéo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaLZg4oVyO8&t=20s

Je vous remercie d'avance pour votre réponse.

Cordialement
@YouDrone

Bonjour, oui bien sûr, l'animation est presque la même que celle présentée dans le player Sketchfab
Bonjour,

Merci de votre réponse.

Pouvons-nous en parler en privé ?

Cordialement
@YouDrone Bien entendu, je vous invite à me contacter par message privé sur le forum sketchfab, ou encore via Facebook
@geoffreycouppey Hey man i love this drone, could i possibly use this model in a game i am currently developing?
@Matt-AeroLab 
Hi, yes you can. Please just name me in your final credit.

Let me know when you finish the game. I would love to see it.

Thanks.
SUPERB!
Iam using solidworks for my designs, I want to re draw it so I was curious to know how did you get the dimensions for inspire 2
@FAUS thanks :)
@Ahmedelkbeer hi this model was Made with photos references and don't respect real quotations.
Great job!
@dybilas Thanks :)
null
hey man great one! is it possible to download the inspire as a static mesh without the animations. Somehow in Unreal it gets twisted, and when i open your file in blender it looks like a drone accident :
@archeologiedenhaag Tanks :)

Yes it's possible to download the INSPIRE 2 in static mesh. Send me your email, i will sent you the OBJ Land pose and the OBJ fly pose static mesh. To texture it use the map of the sketchfab download.

Regards,
yeah thats nice, thanks? i will use it in a vive game (free) for archaeology. i will send you some pictures once i have finished the level with the phantom. can i email you for that?

Hey Jessie,I exported the entire scene as an FBX from Maya, with opacity materials applied only to the faces that needed it [e.g. Ellie's hair and body are two separate objects and materials]. Using a clean scene, I assigned each object with its own texture a unique name since Sketchfab uses the object name to assign textures in the material editor. I had a lot of trouble with it until I finally figured it out, so I hope this helps!
Thanks a lot ^^ I finally got it to work for me as well now :D
Although it's a still scene, if feels like a movie... One of my favorite entries from VG Remix.
do you work as a freelancer? is there an email i can contact you?

Did you let the lights attached on the camera on purpose?
If they are casting shadows, it tends to hinder performances (dynamic shadows), I'm asking because we are thinking about detaching them by default
And I was wondering if artists do that on purpose or just stick with the default presets :).
@stephomi Hello there. I attached the lights on the camera on purpose to get same lighting from any view.
Fantastic work Henrique.
Incredible work, I almost invest half and hour seeing this model. And still amazed. Thank you for sharing.
@paulchambers3d Thank you!
@abielmuren Thank you!
Just keep coming back to this one. Gets my Staff Pick!

Very beautiful girl, especially the face. 
I would like to see your model from the resource

Fantastic work!
Amazink character!
Very well done! I think you have a great artistic eye :)
You are a very dedicated, meticulous and deliberate 3d Artist
Top quality on every aspect of this model.
Did you sculpt?
How long did this take to complete?
@Jydekris Thank you! Yes, a lot of it was sculpted in zbrush. It took a lot of my spare time. 

Glad you liked it!

PS: this scene is a great candidate for our new 'camera limits' feature:

https://blog.sketchfab.com/introducing-camera-limits/
Thanks Matt!

Thanks a lot for the feature Bart! 
I was thinking of using that feature as well but I like it more to give the viewer free roam on how to look at the model because there are details hidden there that you can only see with complete control ;)
Makes sense :) Another update: I've staff picked your work!
Very nice, love the color scheme
I really like your fur. Is the fur on the head created from offset shells?
@peter_turner Yes. You can see them when you switch on the wireframe.
Really love the little detail of the shapes in the blood! Awesome model!!!
Awesome skybox and light set up! Really like the atmosphere you created :)
i love it! you didn't make her hair dyed red on the tips like the game art, but thats not a complaint in any way. i think i like it better this way
null
Thank you for the nice comments!

@lorenceanimation Thanks! Since it's a dream version of her I had the idea early on to put the shapes in her eyes & the blood :)

@drakegraves Thanks! Actually during her astral projection she has a different color palette. Her dyed hair & shirt become a light blue ;)
Letting you know this was featured on IAMAG's Sketchfab Realtime Selection! Congrats!

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-107/
Wow I love the fur! Great job!
This is one of my fav 3d things
Wow this is really well done! The fur looks fantastic. Though I'm having trouble interpreting the wireframe, is it like three meshes on top of each other?
@BMBrice Thanks! I placed 10 meshes on top of each other. I believe that in-engine you could blend in & out some layers depending on how far away the camera is. All 10 should be used for extreme close-ups ;)
you are awsome, where did you studied to do that?
@Arthorius159 Thanks! Mostly I learned this on my own in the recent years.
Excellent! Love the details on the bat and the blood and the eyes, and everything really!
Really good job, and by the way, is it possible for us to include your great work in our AR platform? We are now establishing a big 3D AR content platform. And we are expecting more users can see your model in real life/scene.
Wow, absolutely stunning! Huge fan of NITW! Would love to see this rigged one day!

Pickle Riiiiiiick!!!!
I love this. I need to figure out what that technique is called where it has all the cartoon black lines, like it's a drawing.
@savagebro It's a duplicate of the mesh, expanded (pushed out slightly), with a 100% black texture, and normals inverted.
I saw the episode just a week ago and he is already here! 
I still don't know how he built the first mouse trap when He was only a pickle!
@jeeg He gained mobility with the first cockroach he killed with his teeth, by touching its brain with his tongue. Then he gradually build his way up with more cockroaches until he was strong enough to take on the rat.
This is great! I'd love to use it in a video I've  been working on for my Youtube channel! Is it available to download??
This model is great! Compliments.
Would you be nice to send textures too? I would like to be able to use the model in gta 5, it's amazing!
Congratulations again
Greetings
Antonio
@antouss Thank you! 

Sadly the model doesn't have textures, it uses vertex painting as it's a decimated zbrush model.

If a uv map is created you should be able to bake the vertex colors onto a map.

I would do it myself but I'm waiting on a new pc hard drive after my main drive broke.
@NicksplosionFX Sorry for the late reply. 
The model is now available for download but might require more work if your software cant use vertex based colors for texturing.
Awesome!
I have make a printable version of you drawing that I'm gonna credit to you on thingverse. If you don't mind of course.
@deathtimer Yeah that's fine, as long as its free/I get credit for the model :)
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2573999 If something wrong... tell me
still no textures?
@CRASHFRAME8 No textures exist, the model doesn't even have uv maps. If you enable vertex colour information in your program the 'textures' should be visible.
Hi pasco295 I am struggling to open this file texture.  Most of the 3D files I have opened typically have a .mtl and .jpg with the .obj which is ideal for 3D printing in color.  I would love to be able to test print this guy on our 3D printer.  Are those files something you would be able to supply?  I notice when I do open him up it is solid black.
SÜPER
I was able to get this model to print in color on my Mimaki 3DUJ-553

After about a dozen export attempts I got it to work and print in color.

http://www.xtremesystems.org/fugger/picklerick.jpg

Even though my preview looked black, when I zoomed into the model I could see color and this was my test print.

http://www.xtremesystems.org/fugger/PickleRick.wrl
So sad there is no textures, i would love to use it in VRchat..feels bad :(
Thanks, i'll pain textures by myself. But I'm not going to assign your rights to this model.
An awesome model, thanks a lot!
Fuckinn Boss!

You're getting some draw-order problems on the cape. You might want to switch to Alpha Masking and turn up the threshold to 50 or so: http://puu.sh/hSuXJ/34dc3c07bd.png
Thanks for the comments guys! 

@James: yeah I was wondering about that. Thanks, for the tip. I made the adjustments hopefully the issue is fixed.
Great model!
i love it. nice use of transparency in that cape.
im curious. how many separated objects are into your character ?
I was following the thread for the competition are you taking part in this months event? I have started on a forest troll.
Oh an very cool BTW! Yours was the most accurate of the bunch I believe.
@samholy : Thank you!  Most of the objects are separate as they appear to be. Except the leaves, I used only two different meshes for them.

@joshuawhittaker : Thanks! I was tempted to do this month's challenge but I'm caught up with a bunch of other characters to work on :/. Looking forward to see your forest troll!
Such a cool character! I would love to see a game with him ^^
Inspiring stuff!
He's great! I love the little hands. Hehe.
Love it
Really nice
One of my favourite character pieces here on Sketchfab. I noticed it was VR ready to - give it a try on a cardboard, it's awesome :)
Thanks guys.

As @bartv mentioned, have a go with VR if you've got a cardboard available. I've tried it myself and its great!
Love it. :)

@jarmon thank you, we'll try to optimize scene better in our next work.
Love this guy! Really a good example of using a strong amount of image effects.
Great model! I've removed it from the 'Science, Nature & Education' category though - that didn't seem a very good match.

@bartv Oh, great! You made my day.
Quick tip by the way: the large backdrop image causes some clipping issues when you're close to objects. You should either make it smaller or adjust the 'near clipping distance' in the advanced camera settings.
@bartv Ok, thank for the tip! I just changed the near clipping distance.

@FilipAAOfficial   

hey, sure you can, if you can manage to get the textures right in the scene at least ;P 
if you want to credit me, I would appreciate it ofc ;D

If you are able to do something with this scene. 
send me a mail ;P would like to see the video ^^
Good luck with you projects!

greets
jakob
Hello ! I love this ! 

Did you have an FBX from that ? I would love to do a little motion graphics video out of your model, just for fun.
I am based in Shanghai btw www.herodirector.tv

I try to connect the textures, but from Obj it's a bit impossible I have to say.

Thanks ! 
and of course I credit you + you can also use the animation I'll make from that.

+++
@herodirector  I could send you the 3ds max file.normally there everything is asset tracked. so will be easier :) I'll clean it up first for a min :)
@jakob_van_damme2 thanks mate ! actually I m on c4d ahaha T_T
@herodirector  the downloadlink is in the description for now. 
I don't put this in the comments, because the link will be invalid in 5days.
You can send a mail to jakob.van.damme@student.howest.be  if you did something with the scene or have some issues.
Good luck. 
Greets Jakob!
@herodirector
Ow, whoops. You'll have to wait one day to dowload it. I forgot to put the lamps and the bilboards in the right position.
sweet Jakob ! 

I'll check it out and do a little something animated with it ! I'll send it ones it's done ! 

Thanks !
@herodirector  k, the new fbx file is in the comment. grts jakob

Hey! I just rigged this and I want to know if it's okay if I post it on Deviantart? This is my first rig. And I know that this wasn't meant to be modeled because a lot of it is separate from each other. But still, I'd like to show off my work.

Great rig, thank you for sharing.  I will be having my students use this rig for animating classroom projects.  Thank you.

Breaking the gold parts into their own material could let you really make them shine, if ya know what I mean. Looks so great in the renders, why not do it here too?

@vrhuman Thank you ,glad you like it!   I might finish it if I make time and add some animation too. But who knows...   :)
Really cool =) 

But the tail feel a bit short imo
@jeremygo  Thank you! :)  Yeah,might be,I wasnt using any refference. ..   Technology should help it swim though.. :D
Very cool concept!
@paulchambers3d Thank you! Glad you like the idea!  :)

Quite a few of the edges on the metal look kinda broken, probably would look better with some retopo and clean edges there :)

But a really cool design again, really like your mix between metal and alien/animal forms :)

p.s. if you don't plan to retpopo it send it my way and i do it :D this need some nice textures and a decent topo for the metal bits :)
@dark-minaz Yeah,that is because of the decimation master  within Zbrush. I had to optimize for sketchfab. I actually do plan to finish it. It should be all nice and clean,possibly with more than one texture skins.... :)

Glad you like the design,for now that is all that matters!  :D
@iggy-design oh yeah that one doesn't seem to like hardpolys :P
Great looking forward to the final version then ;) 

Sort of a sci-fi version with some elemental powers as magical floating sci-fi alien wale would look really cool. (so dark green/ blue with some sparks between the spines. ) But i am pretty sure you make something great.
@Doci  Ooh hay i remember you by the profile image on Fb.  Cheers mate! :D  

Glad you like my stuff!   Initially it was just a loose concept for fun,but it took on so much great response that I decided to finish it. 
So now I plan to retopologise ,texture and animate it as soon as i can. :D
super cool concept! seeing this makes me happy!

Thank you very much! I liked the models very much. A small wish, origins put in the rotation. Allows you to quickly put in a pose. Though probably it is possible to adhere to a skeleton. Thanks again.

@Dinoraptor101 haven't setup my store account yet just get in contact: trigon-art.com
too much verts/polys for a shotgun (can be optimized)

Beautiful textures, one thing that struck me as odd though was what a 120X magnification scope was doing on a shotgun. Other than that though again very attractive model
@carbrenn Thanks for the feedback! A scope on a shotgun is nothing too unusual:

How is the textures made? Substance? It looks absolutely amazing, especially on the scope.
@jesperbj Thanks for your feedback! The entire weapons was done in substance painter. I´d used a lot of masks and color variation to make sure to archive a non generic result. In substance painter people often tend to loose uniqueness by just adding smart materials. I build up every material from scratch.

Here you got an example:

@iammalte Thanks for replying. Great work, honestly. You seem to have good control over each individual map. I'm especially impressed with the scratches and edgewear along with you hitting the perfect roughness level/shininess.
@jesperbj  Thanks a lot I appreciate your honesty! When I start a new material I often find myself analysing my references and breaking down each material to it´s base. It always cost a bit of time but at the end it´s worth it. Sometimes just a small rougness value of 0.2 could change a lot :D
@iammalte Jesus Christ dude that is AMAZING but SO expensive :(

The headquarters of the intelligence. I think it is the FSB ;))
Nice work, I down load very few things if any, but I like this little office, slash  factory building. but i am puzzled in that why is it labeled ghetto, or least of all  Futuristic.I choose it because it seems     
to be A nice contemporary office or small shop type of architecture.
If I would have went by just the description I would have missed out. Not complaining, Just saying.
And Thank you very much for sharing your work with us!.
@Xenobe Thanks, and yes the naming of this building is a bit confusing.
It is already over 3 years ago I made this.
This building should be the first piece of a large futuristic building set but I didn't find time to continue the work on it.
But i'm glad you like it and you found a use for this building :)

Thank you 4 replying. i figured as much that it was A self absorbed Procession of the it was good ideal at the time syndrome. such as my life's path of , if you think about it too much, you will never get it done. it is what it is & proceed.

Looks great! I love these minimalistic 3D sceneries.
sweet!
Amazing
Nice detail!
There is something more than just making polygons into objects and that's the composition and story telling. This one is more than great in both ways. 

I have tried to rotate model 180 degrees around and zoom to the deer and the result is still more than fantastic.

This is so beautiful, I love your minimalist pieces :)
This is amazing. Great color palette.
Huge fan of your minimalist scenes! You should configure the VR for them, I would love to check these out on Cardboard
Really wonderful work.  Truly artistic and thoughtful.
This is my aesthetic.
Amazing Style and the atmosphere it evokes
Eye catching.

I love the lighting... What did you textured in?
Map cleanup in MCEdit, model & base texture exported with Mineways, unwrapped UV in ZBrush, baked various textures in 3ds Max and Maya, final texture compositing in Photoshop.
Ahah, that's a workflow! :) Did you upload it straight from photoshop?
Another awesome build, thanks for sharing! I love the work you put into these outside MC. Did you see my goofy mash-up of your castle? https://skfb.ly/ADNn

I'll have to put some more work into it and have things blowing up, etc.
Nah, I uploaded it manually, I had some problem with opacity. The transparent part of the original model wasn't seperated, so I have to import the opacity texture into ZBrush and use it as mask to seperate out the parts, but it's not very accurate. That's why there is a layer of solid water blocks at the lake bed and some parts of the vegetation aren't transparent.
@PadreZippo Yes I've seen your mash-up :) I will also try to add some more effects in future uploads. This was an experiment on transparent textures.
Wow, amazing work! Great job :)
Thanks! :)
Great use of the annotations, I like the way you're presenting the scene ! :)
Thanks! How does the annotation bubbles handles its alignment? It's all on different sides in editor mode, windowed mode and fullscreen mode, which makes it hard for me to avoid blocking features that I want to show.
Absolutely love this. Nice work!
Really nice design and work good, but how di i get up to the surface from the arena when i am down there?

second part is that i would like to se the same design but without all the commandblocks and redstone, is it possible to do? and how dig is the world map?
@fredkjo If this is in a server, the only way out of the arena is death or teleport command, it is a fight to the death areana afterall :P

The minecraft map download link is in the description. I've also rebuild and improved this temple on the ravand.org server (without redstone), you could check it out if interested. Just go to IP: ravand.org, type /warp c, and then type /p v patrixcraft to teleport to my build. Be sure to use the latest conquest texturepack with optifine/mcpatcher installed and connected textures enabled.
@patrix I cant do that thats why i ask, and still how big is the world  and is it on defult mode or large biomes?
@fredkjo What you see here is what you get if you use the map file, it's just one building that I've separated out of the original server map . It's swamp biome, normal world. I don't really understand how you couldn't just download the map file and see it in-game...
Hi,

We are a company developing mini games in Minecraft (Toya www.toyaplay.org/).

We are looking for someone who can creat an exceptional map on Minecraft that will fit our needs in a tight scheduale.
Is this something you are capable and interested doing?

Will be happy to hear from you.

Thanks!
Cool!
Awesome model Patrix - love it :)

Está buenísimo.
It looks really nice, I'm a bit jealous since I haven't figured out how to hand paint and not look blurry. How big is the texture?
@Curazy 2k. Sketchfab makes a bit blurry I find, so I put sharpen post processing which works great.
hank you ?


Reply
man this is so cool such a pretty character. and howd you make that background only visible from the radius but not block the character!!!? o.o
@Mr-Cruz @Curazy 
ty ? the model texture is 2k 
For the background, if you create a sphere with inverted face normals you can create this effect with backface culling, you can turn this on and off in sketchfab options under face rendering single sided
Low poly perfection

Thank you mate :)
This is insanely awesom!
Your final entry is really awesome!! Congratulations for the great work. ^_^
Im curious about your textures, it looks so nitid, and want to ask you something, please is you dont mind to tell me: how many textures and wich size?
BTW, the treasure chest annotation is sooo funny XDDDDDD
Ahah thx a lot ! There are 18 textures, sizes are very different from each other > 256 to 4096 :)
@graphictravelling Thanks a lot for the reply :)
this is spectacular! 
wish i could have finished mine.

all the best! I'll be rooting for this one :)
The key of the treasure chest is somewhere :)
Great background texture, too
congrats! 
had a feeling about this one.. 
especially when i saw the tiny details like that bit of spinal chord etc..
The level of detail you added is really something else - great job!
Congratulations Dynast! You have won the second prize in our WoW Legion Fan Art contest!

https://blog.sketchfab.com/world-warcraft-legion-fan-art-contest-winners/

I'll be in touch for your prizes :)
How was this model sectioned off using the number navigation???

I absolutely love it.

Can anyone give me a tip?
Thank you all it was really great to work for this contest :)
Congrats!
WOW!!! Great Work, congrats
thanks a lot ! @seori

@curlscurly Thank you very much! :) Blending colors took a lots of time so i am very glad you like it :)
Love the colors and the architecture as well as the chains transitioning into the background!
@essimoon Thank you very much! :) I ve been trying to stay true to real japanese architecture as much as was possible and added the dissapearing chains to add some fantasy feeling to it :)
amazing, great use of colors, love the hidden pond!
@cotman_sam Thank you very much Sam :) Loving yours as well :)
Looks amazing, i really love the little details like the carpet, the little pond, and that the 2 giant rocks behind look like bunny ears :P
@dark-minaz Thank you very much! :) Was a lots of fun making this one, the carpet was one of the first things i did right after environment, haha didnt thought of the bunny ears XD liking that idea haha
Was curious how long did this take to build, unwrap and texture all together roughly would you say? :) it's ok if you are not sure how long exactly :) I'm making a sort of scene diorama and not sure how long it's going to take me. Thanks :)
I love this. I'm going to give this a staff pick
@bartv Thats amazing! Thank you very very much! :)
@ExplodedNun hard to say exactly as i was working on other assignments as well so i am quite lost at timing, but i think the modeling took like 5-6 days (the roof took a lots of time) as i was changing and styling it more and more but then i had to start unwrapping and texturing already but meanwhile i sometimes modeled some new stuff, so modeling was in the end maybe 6-7 days. The unwrap wasnt all that difficult and was quite fast, i just sometimes had to change it because i changed map layouts (to reduce amounts of textures) so not more than full day. And texturing was firstly only about colors and gradients to make sure it all fits and have been detailed towards the end so maybe 3-4 days. But as i was doing these things at the same time sometimes to control the result (was checking all my tests on sketchfab always) its hard to say how long exactly. Hope this helps :)
@dominika.bariakova Yeah this helps a lot :) Looks amazing btw!
Wonderful creation!
@gujr Thank you! :)

Wow,  : D thats  what i call a nice color harmonie.
@dadagutz Thank you very much :) Loving to play with colors
It's amazing ?

Can I ask uv map is what software is used?   Thanks?
@lhd123452000 Thank you :) I used 3ds max for unwrapping, however you could use different programs as well, i think learning 3dcoat might be useful for uvs but i personally didnt had much time to experiment.
Thanks for these suggestions!

@whmh Thank you
@jeanvidal as far as I can tell, I believe it's one sided lighting/shading (where only the front face of a polygon is rendered and the back faces are culled. If you think about it, it's because the room is in an inside out cube, with the rendered faces on the inside and the back faces on the outside) 

If I recall correctly, it's available in the sketchfab 3D settings when you import your models.

You probably already got your answer to this a few months ago, if not I hope I was able to help!

Hello, where is Roughness in unity shader?
@lazyclan 

Hello ,

There is only metallic and specular in unity shader.

Roughness can be used in alpha channel of metallic map.
For the best results use substance painter and export textures as Unity 5 standard Metallic.

There isn't any Robins mask implemented in the topology of the face. The cape geometry is kinda spotty, should be able to easily slice vertical cuts
look at hippiedrome for reference on topology.

Hi, I work for an outsource of star wars product, and I was wondering if we could use this comercial use? (Our client has the star wars licence)
@foxdie491 Hello ! I'm sorry but I can't accept your ask, this model is under creative common rights.
@boittemike1 No problem Michael. Thanks for your Reply!
Thank you for letting me use your model. https://vimeo.com/248124180
@phoebearjona Hey ! No problem, nice simulation ! That's quite fun seeing it explode haha
This is really cool and I love the inside of it.
Wow, you've reached 1,000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@bartv Thanks :D Yes, I was preparing something for that special day.... You can now see it here : https://skfb.ly/6KYBr :)
Awesome :)
i am trying to use it in blender but cant get the window to become transparent 
so u know how to fix it
@Zarg_ Hello ! Here is a little explanation about alpha texture : https://blenderartists.org/t/cycles-and-alpha-texture/513328/5

You have to link the tie_sphere_transparent.png to a mix-shader and transparent BSDF, and the mix-shader to diffuse, like in this picture : https://blenderartists.org/uploads/default/original/3X/d/6/d6ef1bc384eb245f76aae62479edadd9e91d3d0d.jpg

Hope it'll help ?

Amazing, Battle Chasers style is so solid and consistent. Loving every bit of it!
It's just amazing, one of best painting textures that i saw !!!

It's really great low poly model. i'm reconsidering my way of thinking. How hand painted details can fool eye. it's incredible.
Texture is really perfect.

Sorry, my mistake, found it !!! ;)
I still have some problems, I downloaded the model as .OBJ, it opens in Photoshop and also in Preview on my iMac, but I don't see the right colors in PS and it is only grey in Preview, with witch program do I have to open this 3D to see the colors as given on Sketchfab
Hi Maxromash.
Beautiful model.
Is it possible to have the texture with camouflage colors?
These textures are present in World of Warship.

Amazing and perfect. If I didn't know better I'd think this was from a 3D version of Chrono Trigger. ?
Absolutely fantastic! Making a 3D model out of a 2D character must require an insane amount of skill!
Well done! My only suggestion would be to change the background. Even a solid color would be nice. The grunge clashes with the aesthetic and takes away from your work.
Really looks like a drawing made 3d! 

How'd you get that pen-stroke effect?

Nice work! what soft did you use ?
3dmax, ps, viewport canvas
Looks great! Giving it a Staff Pick :)
Thank you Natalia :)
I love the style. Stoopid question this (I'm new to Sketchfab): How do you turn off the filtering on textures? Is it in the Source material before Sketchfab import, or is it a rendering option in Sketchfab?
Thanks GreyPea. That would be a combination of setting up the albedo maps as nearest in sketchfab editor plus adding a bit of sharpening in postproduction , again inside Sketchfab editor. It gives you the same level of non antialiasing as maya/max viewport
We recommended your work for the October Sketchfab roundup on 3D Total:

Thank you very much, Bart :)
Such a cute little one :3
Really cool - what do you mean when you say Overpainting AO in Viewport Canvas - very interested in your process!
Photoshop like native at your regular 3d max. Allows you to paint over 3d. I use it for a first pass over the lowpoly´s AO. Then refine in photoshop if needed

How'd you texture the smoke? I'm guessing there was a lot of light mapping involved.
Hey, glad you like it :D

So the smoke texture was a tough one but once i got a decent model it fell into place.

To create the model I created lots of spheres outlining the shape then merged them into one smooth surface then added displacement and noise to give it more interest and a better shape.

Once i had the model i rendered and Ambient occlusion, i used this as a mask in photoshop so that i would get fire in the creases but not on the outer parts. Then i just used a cloud texture overlay for the rest of the geometry.

The billows coming off are just a smoke image with an alpha applied to curve planes.

I will be making a blog post about the creation of this piece which will hopefully shed some more light on the techniques i used.
Cool cool. Please send me the link to the blog post once you it online. I'd be keen to take a closer look!
wow as amazing as this is, I cant even rotate it on my 2014 rMBP... *cry*
Thats crazy! it is a pretty heavy scene as I did not have time to optimise the vehicle...

But it runs on my Samsung S5 phone!?

OMG thank you @bartv
This is Great!, but how did you animate her face? 
I have a fbx file that has facial animation, but it does not work when I upload it to Sketchfab?

I would appreciate your feed back, thanks.
@lioness7 i made a pretty silly facial rig using just bones, and animated them. Didn't used any controllers or constraints. Maybe you should try baking the animation when exporting, in that case if you have any controller it will bake the animation in every single frame! c:
so cool O_O
You assumed that I used bones to rig my facial animations, but you are wrong!

I used facial morphs!
@graograman thank youu! t_t
@lioness7 oh i didn't! sorry for the missunderstanding. Tho... i actually used morphs... uhmm maybe because we are still in beta things are not working too smooth now. Try contacting @bartv and get him check your file! (in the case you have not already done that) c:
Correct, we're still working on morph target support. For any support questions, the best place would be our support forum:

Wait, does her mouth at the start supposed to look like that?
dat mouth though...
@AgultoDesigns hahaha i know right
@kinshin110 been a while since i posted here and i forgot about that haha
OMG how had I not seen this?! I love her! And the ANIMATION on this is so good!!!
@artofsully awhh haha now worries made this years ago! haha i love her so much, maybe i should make a 2.0 version^^

Had my coworker print it on his 3D printer (don't know what he has. Can't remember. and I don't have my own printer yet) it looks sick! https://photos.app.goo.gl/WyI7o49BSBoQfTQe2
hi 
what is your email address ?
null
Thanks for the 3d model, I am a begginner in 3d animations and i started with your model, its awesome, if you want i can send you your model in blender with the bones to animate it, thank you
how do i download it? i see the download button but i can't figure out how to put it in blender!
also it looks amazing! (better than what i can do!) but im a complete freak about stranger things and just as a bit of help, the demogorgon only has 5 mouth things 
not 6 but, and it has a toe on the the side of its leg like a dog does but other than those minor things it looks great!
@NokisDemox  could you send me the model with bones? i'm trying to make a test horror film and i love stranger things!
@bbignumber7 yes there is a download button
null
Could you make it a T-pose? Maybe one with mouth closed?
Why chicken foots?
@Bobjenz I second this request. I would love to use your Demogorgon in a game I'm currently working on in Unity. You will get full credit for your work but I will require the model in a T pose if possible. My email is paulelder144@hotmail.com if you want to chat about it :)
le models a d rige ?
Thank you for posting for free!

@brandonramkahalawan the color re vertex colors, depending of your renderer there's diferent way to apply it
ok thanks for the info im able to get the color in blender but when trying to export to other formats it is without it will try to figure out something or do up the colors myself
How I can upload it to VRChat?
@manydoddoli Open it in blender, export it as FBX, import it to unity
null

hello, i read your comment below that says open it in blender, export as fbx and import to unity, but the tris is around 80-82k, and of course, i need it to be below 20k. i tried doing exactly what you said anyway, and of course it wouldn't let me upload it to vrchat because of the polycount. my problem is that when i get it below 20k, it turns out like this i.imgur.com/9nK3hGK.png do you have any tips on how to preserve quality or  fix those black things on the eyes and around the mouth?
@YuriCream i will post a lowpoly version , give me an hour
@YuriCream Here it is, is 5K triangles https://i.imgur.com/JYU00SQ.png

@juanmendoza thank you so much! i really appreciate it
@YuriCream Hey i was wondering i you finished that player model and if u did can you send it to me im having problems over at my side.

Hi @Juan Mendoza

First of all thanks for your work!

But i had some problems with the model for VRChat

I managed to get the model to work on VRChat: imgur.com/fzfIjjD

But there were some issues, when i exported the .FBX file from blender to Unity i get 2 walls: imgur.com/aHxgTJm

When i uploaded the avatar to VRChat the walls apeared too. So after alot of fidgeting etc (still new to custom avatars) i could not delete it in unity.

So i returned to Blender and took a look at the Outliner tool: imgur.com/8FzdEx7 (red marks my problem)

What i did: Removed them in blender and re-exported the file to .FBX Format for unity, it worked!

so when i was finished with that problem the skeleton had some problems too: imgur.com/jAXTJs0

The upper chest was active. but VRChat sdk will not upload if you have that one enabled. So i removed that one.

Thats where i got another error message: imgur.com/POja81u

This one was a little tricky so i had to ask help from my brother. he changed the normal chest to chest-1. then it worked perfectly!

I'm sorry for this long post but maybe other people had some more problems with this model in VRChat.

Can i mail the working model to you? since you own the rights :D then you can upload it here again!

And again i love this model! Thank you so much for making this!

Greetings,

Quentintje

(i already sent an email but stays here if it has a solution)
half of the model is gone when i put it in unity...what am i doing wrong?

@dimplepwr yep, but we get payed to do what we already know :) 
the experimenting usually comes from your own curiosity instead of the job
sometimes i find it intimedating but once you start it is great
Nice, staff-pick!

The strong shadow-casting sun directional light (detached from camera!) really adds a lot.
@stephomi thank you :)
I usually like to detach my lights from the camera because then I have a chance to light the model the way i want. I find that otherwise the light and shadow can obscure the model.
Wow, what output setting do you use to export for sketchfab?
@jeankepler that is a very broad question :)
i am planning on doing a tutorial on this soon
which should answer your question

Hi, I tried downloading it and converting it to an .stl, and .obj file. The converters could not read the .dae file at all....

Looks very nice, though.
Come on! how do I even put the textures on there
Can anyone tell me how to make a 3d model like this one? Is there sketchfab software?
@RookBytes Sketchfab is only a sharing plateform, to create models you have a lot of softwares like Blender/3DSMax/Maya/Tinkercad/Photoshop CC/Sculptris/... But it's not that simple to create models ^^

Very disturbing when in the dark and mysterious, much more human when zoomed in. Can I ask how many photos did this take and did you use the highest proccessing options when using Photoscan?

Thanks for reading and well done!
Wow the effect is amazing, would you be willing to write a quick step-by-step tutorial for our blog? That might be a bit easier to understand than the gif.

Anyway, I'm staff picking it!
@bartv Oh wow great!! Thanks Bart :D ! I'm going to write down the process for making this. But it involves custom scripts I've made for a video game I'm working on. The scripts are still work in progress and not ready to be distributed for the moment. However, I can share some code snippets to help understand the mesh generation.
@tigs Thanks :) ! The vertex shader displaces the points. It gives the possibility to sculpt with code, to make generative art. The motivation was to crystallized a real-time effect into a standard mesh.  
I think I took too many photos, like at least 15. Pros say you don't need so much, I guess they are right. But I'm just having fun with Agisoft Photoscan for the moment.  
If I remember well, the high quality for dense point cloud was not as good as the medium quality. (I don't know why)
Oh by the way, I've moved this model from 'Cultural Heritage' to 'Characters'.
WOW!
WHAT THE.. Amazing!
Awesome stuff! How many points are in this model? I work with very large point cloud files and would love to integrate this workflow. Thanks!
just amazing

Nice! I'd recommend adding a tiltbrush tag to make sure your work shows up in the dedicated gallery http://sketchfab.com/tags/tiltbrush
@JazzaStudios also 2 side notes: you can review this in VR with your Vive straight from the Sketchfab player itself, and you can include the original tilt file in your sketchfab upload if you want it to be downloadable from here.
good one...
This was great for being your first characters sketch in the program.
that is so cool jazza i wass standing in the iron giants hand! can you believe it? IN HIS HAND!!!!

By the way, you can help performance (especially on mobile) by joining all the meshes that share a material (e.g. all the trees). We do this on our end for static scenes, but not for animated scenes yet.
Thanks Will do that!
Such a great job! Love the animation!!!
Very cool indeed. Just one thing - I removed this model from the 'Characters' category (that's for human characters). Cheers!

thanks Nico.!  This model was uploaded by Nora Al Badri and Jan Nelles, german artists,  as an artistic intervention in order to inspire a critical revision of today,s colonial notion of possession in Germany and in the world. They scanned the head of Nefertiti clandestinely, without permission of the museum. Add4d wants to collaborate in this initiative making diffussion of it in this space. We work every day to document and divulge the common heritage making it attractive and accessible using the latest technology.
You have a point with this colonial notion of possession, it's all very pretty, but please tell me what to do with all the museums, monuments and digs in Iraq? How's Palmyra doing nowadays? When is the Cayro Museum of Antiquities going to br blown?
Thank you. It,s interesting the access to wikipedia.

A good way to add information to the model.
There is always a lot yet to be done. We can always think about what is to be done. We think big but act small. For example we have worked with the project Mosul . What do you think can be done in all those places which you speak ? What are you willing to do? Thanks @sinnergic @mmorao
That is not an easy matter. Remember the famous Elgin Marbles controversy. At the time it was indeed a very good idea, but nowadays are the Greek monuments in such need of rescue? Also there is all the art that was plundered by the Nazis, not all of which is found nor settled. Different times and different situations require different criteria. Nefertiti belongs to the Egyptian people, but is it not true that she belongs to the entire world? Again, not an easy matter.
Today with our work as documentalists we can do it´s that heritage can be accessible worldwide . Millions of people never go to Egypt and not to Berlin but today can explore this piece and many other pieces and places.

let's continue talking about the owning of the heritage . At the same time let´s continue working to preserve it and make it known .
Thank you for sharing this important image. We are forever appreciative of your unselfeshness
I'm very excited to find this model.  I plan to share it with others.
@add4d 
About how many photographs do you use for an object like this?  I am just beginning and greatly appreciate your wonderful work here.
Thanks.! @leealley  This is a work done with scanner.
Nice scan, very accurate result!

@graft Thanks!
Excellent! I love this! Great colours and design.

Just want to mention a minor nit-pick that might improve how the pixel texture is rendered; it looks like you've maybe scaled up the image with no interpolation in an image editor to get the pixelated look in the texture? The problem is texture filtering still happens in the renderer and it softens the nice sharp lines in your pixel art and adds very minor artifacts to the edges of some quads. If you upload the original low resolution file and turn off texture filtering, the texels will be even crisper (providing the texture dimensions are a power of two; 32, 64, 128 etc. - otherwise a server side algorithm resizes them into a lossy format that destroys the pixel look again).
Awesome work! I've been following the artist for ages and loved seeing their post of your modeled rendition of their art.
@vabart Thank you! I only discovered his work a couple days ago and I absolutely love it! Will probably model an other one of his tiny storefront :)
@EloraP Please do! I'm looking forward to it! :)

What tools do you you use for a character like this?Zbrush? Marvelous designer? Substance Painter?
@aremisty You can send me a DM on Twitter, my account is public in my profile.
@aaolson817 Thanks! No, sorry I have no video, maybe some day! For most of my models I use:

- Zbrush for sculting
- 3DSMax/Blender for modelling, retopo
- Unfold3D for unwrapping
- Substance Painter for texturing
- Marmoset Toolbag/Sketchfab for realtime rendering
Absolutely awesome. Can I do a 3D render of this and credit you for the model. Are you on behance?

wow, you are elite! Nice work!
amazing work i to ispire
Hi ? could you maybe rig the model and reupload it so I can use it? there is no rig on the model sadly.
@Rubenjanlouwes Hi Ruben, I made a basic rig at the time to pose it, I think it should be there, otherwise I'm sorry but I don't currently have time for rigging and also it's not my biggest strength. Best.
Hey, I didn't notice it the first time when I commented, but how did you make the eyes move like that only when you change the camera position? It also triggers and blink and then the eyes rest back to center....How? Thanks!
It's not something I did on purpose, I think it's a Sketchfab bug when opacity is set to refraction, it happens in all models with refraction enabled.
Dear Keianhzo, I would like to ask if you could make the model T or A-pose so I can rig it myself. Could you please do this for me since when I try to autorig it , it needs to be in a t-pose or A-pose. This is for a school project/ Kind regards, Ruben Louwes (Krale)

Mi sugerencias son: Incluir a Cuicuilco y hablar de la Cuenca de México no del Valle de México. Buen trabajo
Polígono del nuevo aeropuerto, sería mucho pedir?
Zona urbana?
Gracias 
baruchoooo por la sugerencia, Cuicuilco agregada.  Exploraguacom el polígono es fácil  y la zona urbana es excelente idea aunque me llevaría un poco de tiempo para  darle la mayor precisión posible y claro lo podríamos agregar a otro mapa, gracias por el aporte.
se ve increible!, pregunta: la profundidad del lecho lacustre es realista?, gracias por compartir!
El contorno es basado en un plano reconstructivo del Arq. Luis Gonzáles Aparicio, pero la profundidad no, evidentemente los niveles de profundidad han cambiado con el tiempo y aunque son muy parecidos con los actuales, en algunas zonas son muy diferentes a los datos documentados, sobre todo las pobladas que han sufrido hundimientos importantes, así que tuve que modificar la profundidad para que el contorno  se ajustará, pero no de una manera precisa en cuanto a profundidad, en este mismo perfil encontrarás otro mapa 3D de relieve (? https://skfb.ly/GstN) con los niveles de profundidad actuales, lo puedes descargar, saludos.

Hola, disculpa, estudio urbanismo y acabo de aprender a usar esta herramienta para presentar proyectos, quisiera saber  si renderizaste con texturas, y como le diste el acabado al suelo,
leonardoescobarheredia, lo que me preguntas da para mucho, sin embargo todo se resume en comprender el workflow PBR (Physically Based Rendering), en este caso es más parecido al que se usa para videojuegos que para cine. Checa este link de sketchfab ?https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/204429595-Materials-PBR?utm_source=website&utm_campaign=pbr_landing. En especifico, el terreno lo cree usando texturas de alta resolución obtenidas de google earth, las limpie con photoshop, aunque hay software que te genera texturas procedurales como World Machine, las demás texturas que use para aumentar la calidad son obtenidas a partir de una geometría con alta densidad de triángulos, sobre todo el ambient occlusion map, cavity map y normal map. Para la textura de piedra use Quixel un generador de texturas automáticas también lo puedes hacer con Substance Designer, pero es más fácil y rápido con la primer herramienta cuando necesitas  algo predefinido y no tan personalizado. Finalmente para el lago uso 2 geometrías traslapadas una con una textura semitransparente y con un mapa normal que simula agua y otra geometría abajo con una textura difusse que da los colores.
Se me olvidaba, la geometría del terreno se genera a partir de un mapa de altura, una imagen en escala de grises donde entre más blanco sea el pixel, más alto es el vértice y entre más negro más bajo queda el vértice, la imagen en grises la obtuve convirtiendo con QGIS un mapa de elevación del INEGI  y con zbrush se crea la geometría a partir de la imagen en grises, el mapa de elevación no te lo lee cualquier programa, aguas con eso.
excelente trabajo amigo!
@proxemic Gracias!
Tu trabajo es muy bueno, una grata sorpresa
@GerardoArch Gracias.

I've completed the Rig. Thanks again for sharing your awesome model, and enjoy the rig!
I was wondering if I could download either Dead Pool or Batman? I'm looking to start my next rig project and the Batman character would be interesting to apply N-Cloth on cape. Dead Pool is really super cool looking with all the guns etc...  I just need something that has UV's and texture. Then I'll give you the rig when I'm finished.
Now all my models can be download.
Be free to download all my models.
:)
Incredible model, but when I view it off-line, I don't get the textures to show like the Deadpool one does. I use a few different viewers and nothing shows color.
@sickindahead -- the UV's are symmetrical so they are laying on top of each other. But you should be able to reconnect them with a surface shader. are the texture files missing? Are you using MAYA?
like
um hello i want to ask you something well first this model is insanely cool and there is thing am i allowed to just change some small things on it or model over it because i need to make my animatronic and his endo skeleton is covered by those musels so can i please use it

This one of my favorites ever
thanks @w_mat_brown - glad you like it! I was impressed with how RealityCature ..er.. captured the spines. If I get time (probably never) I'll try and fix the fins.

@duisengaliyevs it is! ??
Nice scan @nebulousflynn, yes, RealityCapture has handled the spines very well ... something photoscan would struggle with. 

Which RealityCapture licence do you use? .. I have been looking into purchasing it, but it seems very expensive in comparison to photoscan, not sure if I am missing something?
Hey @paul3uk -  currently using the 3 month €99 license. As it is still beta software I would expect some re-shuffle of pricing once released proper (but don't quote me on that, it's just a guess)
That's amazing @nebulousflynn! Gets my staff pick.
Quick scan? It's an amazing scan!!
wow !
beautiful, n1, the skin looks very materialistic and detailed! thumbs up!
Impressive details at this time!
Great to see animal scans that aren't just the skeleton. I hope there will one day be ones of big cats. Amazing scan by the way!
@3ddude101 thanks, there are lots of taxidermy scans from natural history museums being added to sketchfab all the time. How about this Cougar by @tauricity https://skfb.ly/WxJ6 :)

@johngreenstone thank you Andre, all credit to RealityCapture :)

@Marcemellow @gerpho cheers!

@egiptologo91 thank you! I only had about 15mins to take the photos, so that was the quick part.

Cheers @alban :D
Amazing result!
thanks you @RaizVR :)
Imagine if it was a slow scan... :D Impressive work! Congratz.
Great model, would love to use it in one of my ArchViz visuals as a prop, any way to download?
thanks @carpetudo - I call it a 'quick scan' as photography took roughly 15 minutes in a non-studio environment. I've added a photo of where it was scanned to the description - on the corner of a table by a window in a busy function room :)

@VKVvisuals as this was a demonstration for the BNSS I can't offer it for download right now. If this changes I'll update the model permissions.
OK, thanks Thomas, I will wait it out :-) and thanks for getting back to me so quickly, bye, Mac
Beautiful scan; nice work on the spines, thin fins, mouth and eyeballs. I'll investigate RealityCapture.
thanks @ARC-3D - RC worked really well with the spines, if I ever get time I'd like to fix the fins (they're not quite as tattered in real life :)
When I first looked at your model I saw the fin on top and noted that it looked quite good. Some of the others do have some tattered sections, which is something I struggle with as well. An error in alignment that would be otherwise unnoticeable can cause a fin to model with a negative thickness (i.e. a hole). I've asked Agisoft whether the software could detect this and correct for it; I'll let you know if they respond. The model is still beautiful.
null
very beautiful
@ARC-3D Hey did you ever hear back from Agisoft regarding this issue? We're working on some stuff with some neuroscientists and we're having a similar issue with cichlid brain imaging. 

Best,

i hope this majestic, disgusting, sea mosquito will be added to the game!
Loved the concept art and now the CGI model is just as great.  Very Wayne Barlow in design.  Of course, the game will need a large somewhat flat biome for these creatures.  It doesn't look like they could move very well around hilly terrain or places with a lot of canyons/holes.
oh I did not notice that front leg is its head... that adds a whole new level of disturbing...
Not sure if you noticed, Jack, but you can rotate the images here by holding down the left mouse button on them and zoom in or out with the scroll wheel.
Yes I did notice, I'm not a complete idiot.
Never said you were, just pointing out that you could. :)
this is the WIP creature im most exited about!
It's a shame the model here doesn't have a small main character below it to show the scale.  These guys are going to be quite big.
its butthole is made 4 pooping wait oh yeah ecause it is gonna be able to poop in the game eventually!! wow!
Look at this beauty!!

I helped make a STEM game for 5th graders that enabled them to explore a coral reef; but our source material was nowhere near quality.
Hello Matt, Yes we are very interested in developing this into interactive content and VR. send me a message at sly@thehydro.us
If I share on facebook, the 3-D Model does show up, but is partially sliced. Can I get a download?
Hi,
We have a new 3D printer at our school.  Would it be possible to be able to download this image or any other image you think would be good as a test run.  We hope to be able to take our own 3D images of coral and print them as well to investigate coral health for my marine science class.

This model looks very natural and alive.
great job on the lips and nose!
OMG! This is awesome! I lOVE IT <3
Tnx, Chabe. It's a magic of your art
Congrats! We put your work to be featured by ItsArt Mag this week: http://www.itsartmag.com/features/sketchfab-realtime-models-selection-29/
Hola, I would message you but I am not sure if I can on here... but if you have time do you think that you could make some stuff from this? https://www.behance.net/gallery/21815431/Crafting-14-Comic and if you have time and are willing to make some then could you make them downloadable?
Hello, Ian, may be some time I'll do something like this, but I make downloadable only the things that I've made by my own concepts.
Awesome
she's super adorable. lots of character here.
niice
i love the style, great work, really inspiring
Very unique looking. Great job!
Excellent work on the sculpt and especially the retopo. We see too many auto-retopo around. Polygon cruncher, Zremesher (terrible), 3DCoat auto-retopo (very powerful) and so on. And it feels really good to look at a very well hand made low poly mesh with proper baking. Love your work dood.
null
sculpt ?
@matheussouza lowpoly model with baked maps from highpoly sculpt on Zbrush
@lera.nilova Beautiful. Photoshop or Substance ? You use the maps( thinkness, curvature etc) to helping in paint ? or handpainted ?
@matheussouza ty ^_^ Specifically, this work has been done more a year ago . I had other views on the payplane, not quite reasonable :D The model textured in classic shading (diffuse, normal, specular) in Photoshop. I used the classic occlusion, baked direct light Maya, cavity map. I mean this should look much more nicer if I only did it on pbr. But I decided to do her like this T_T
Very good) She looks so familiar... Just like my good friend) Awesome!
P.S. in shadeless mode looks great too)

@auxfuel I am but this isn't part of that. This model was just for fun. A stand alone thing :)
I love it. It's amazing how much life an idle animation adds, doesn't it? Staff picked!
@bartv Thanks! For sure, subtlety is key :)
So nice the cyclic animation.  It brings the model to life even in a almost static position.
Really cool character, you captured a lot of personality with this.  Nice work.
@pereirarb Thanks. Animation really does help loosen things up :)

@drawnwithlead Glad you get some character out of this. That's the most important part I find.
Very nice!
@vincent.yip Thanks!
Great character :)

How sad can it be when it has a cactus with shades?
This makes me want to watch a depressing short animation

Absolutely wonderful. Simple idea, but so much detail. I actually find small space like this very comforting.
I love it!
Quite welcoming in a strange way, I love the way the thumbnail lights the office as you scroll over it.
Did a update on the textures to post it on my Behance page, redid the atlas UV manually and bake everything again, now the textures look less blurry, more details on the floopy disks and postits.. think everything got better now.
How is this model sad? I think it looks fabulous!
@animator12 agreed! Use shadeless shading mode and it looks pretty cheery
ok @animator12 @HongZhihao  you spoted the true.. its not this sad hahauhauah I failed i think XD
When you make these models do you make the textures your self or you get them of the internet, and i love this work
hey @XMA I did the textures by hand after some bake.
brilliant!
I like the environment model, myself I am young environment artist this type of work motivate me to become better. Thanks for the inspiration.
nice one
lovely:)
Waw, that's incredible! It feels so simple. The lil cactus takes the cake for me though :D

Yes a model would be greatly appreciated for the purpose of 3d printing a very cool conversation starter for by work desk :)
so cute! : 3 please do a 3d printable object ^^
The positive aspect is that, since this earlier tank design is more boxy than the later tank designs, with a few slicing it can be printed with very good surface quality :)

Love it, staff pick!
@alban Thanks! Glad you like it!
I dig it
cool
wow =O thats incredible.
Very artsy. I like it.
Excellent work. I feel that your pieces both overcome and embrace some of the current limitations in VR art. Very cool. Instant follow.
We loved this so much we shared it on social! Hope this brought people over who appreciate it as much as we do!

The Allosaurus looks like a T. rex with a beak. Not that that's a bad thing, it's beautiful.
I followed you from the beginning ??. Wait, how am i able to make my own? please help me.
Thank you Slimee! to make artwork like this you will need a VR setup either Oculis, Vive or Windows mixed reality. I have an Oculus Rift and I use a software called Quill.
Gorgeous work!!
amazing!!
Just purchased the model, really excited about checking ut your work. It looks awesome!
@Mctarr Thank you for your purchase! Let me know if you have any problems or need any help with it.
Gorgeous style and creature design!

so beautiful and cute ^.^
This is a super neat idea to have a ghost with bones. It is so unique and honestly just plain cool! Good job on  the model and materials too. ? Have a great day.
How do you make the transparency of the material?
This would be really cool to print the skeleton with a 3D printer, and the transparency part with a Resin Printer. ?
lovely
Awesome ?

@louis @laurieannis @Ewan-DU @awdddwo @David.Antalek Thank you!

@louis Thanks! No problem, I forgot to make it downloadable, now it's fixed but maybe you will have some issues on the top and bottom of the sphere because of its particular unwrapped.
This is awesome! What did you use to draw it?
Nice work, and an intriguing idea. Snow globes? Christmas ornaments? Someday somebody will take the ink jet out of a paper printer and squeeze it into a 3d printer, and man will we have fun then!
@Ychty I use Blender3d from start to finish to do this.
Awesome, really cool. I love it how you set it up into the snowglobe. It is awesome to be in there and you see only the World inside it, but from the outside you see it isn't real... :D
aww I was disapointed to see the environment was not 3d, still looks amazing though!
interesting?
Great Idea!
Dope.
Simply, AMAZING!
totally awesome
Do you create all the 2D drawing  in blender?
@alain.peyrard Around 95% was done in Blender and the other 5% in Photoshop, but it can be drawing all within Blender.
woow !!!
super
you're brilliant!
@santiagoramet Thanks!!!
you have some truly beautiful work

I have a few animator friends, if I were to convince them to animate this, would you be okay with providing the mesh/rig? If it's not rigged you can just provide the mesh and make it downloadable. It would be so cool to see someone animate this!
Thank you very much for the kinda words!

I would absolutely love to see her animated for sure. The rig I used was cobbled together with 3DS Max's Biped system so it likely wouldn't be usable to you guys for animation. BUT...I just released the SDK file for this on Polycount as there have been a couple requests for her file.

http://www.polycount.com/forum/showpost.php?p=2326308&postcount=82

Hope that helps and please keep me updated if you decide to use her. =)
Goodness, this is beautiful.

Would you mind if I made a Super Smash Bros. Brawl mod of this?
Ha ha, if you can figure out how to get her in and working, that would be amazing! It would be a blast to see her hopping around all over the place.
Oho, the problem isn't getting her working, it's getting permission. And I have permission now. Thanks!

I don't have the time to make her a moveset, but I should be able to make a nice costume. Look forward to it!
spider man unlimited
This is definitely the best Spider-Gwen model I have seen. I'd love to rig this up and try building a Unity game project starring her.
hi! Im working on a project with Marvel at the moment- can i contact you about getting the chance to utilize your rig?
Heya @bungalow12

Sorry I missed your comment the other day. You absolutely welcome to grab Gwen's SDK from the Polycount forum. =)

I'm updating the link here since the recent switch with the Polycount website disabled some of the older forum links:
http://polycount.com/discussion/comment/2326308/#Comment_2326308

Hope that helps and I'd love to see anything you end up doing anything with her.
Used this fantastic to make some personal fan art, thank you for sharing your work

i.imgur.com/BNGjJKB.jpg
Hey, if you're still doing stuff here, the polycount download link doesn't work anymore.  Would you mind updating it?
@Dolores_I Oh for sure! Looks like when Dropbox updated their system, it broke everyone's public links. I'll upload a new version of her SDK later today.
@Rocketeer Thanks a lot, it's really appreciated.
@Dolores_I New link up and running!

Thanks @bartv for the information !
I love the historical information along with the great model. Congratulations!
Diogofigueiredo,

I'm glad that you like the historical background.  I do it because I want to so more that just make pretty models.  I want to make 3D content that is both attractive and useful.
@omnidirectional You've succeeded!  TYVM!!
Hello its a wonderful job. Would you mind if i use it? As a scene for my indie game project? I am just trying to get peoples attention at the time, and creating representative sketches, i wouldn't use it as an asset in final version.
What ever is an answer I want you to know that it is inspiring. if you want i can share with you my own drone photogrammetry.
@kristijonasbakas 

Give me credit and you can use it.  I'd like to see what you can do with it.  I may even be able to make a higher quality version with different pre-processing.
Thanks alot. I will link you once its done.
Filip AA,

What Modeling software do you use? This looks incredible!
@Caddybug1 Just replied by mail ;)
Beautiful work, grats !
Hey there, so I recently just started animation and was wondering if it would be possible to use this model? I can't seem to purchase it.

Fantastic model! really like this version :)
Definitely my favourite of the stylised characters that you've made :)

Looking forward to seeing what you make next ^^
do one for funtime freddy

(?? • ? • )?? Yes
@raggedystar hi i was wondering how do you install devinart stuff to Iyan3d pro(if yo even know what that is)
im stunned
This looks lovely. I could see this being used in a high quality animated short or a teaser for a full on movie. Do you have any plans to animate?
That's great! I'm staff picking it :)
Awesomely done! Good job :D
This is super creepy. I love it. I really like the grime details all over the doll. The camera blur makes it seem creepier but also really hard to look at the model. Spinning her around gives me a headache lol. She is really good.
@bartv Omg thank you so much!!! ;w;
@lawlordp Thank you! ^^
@v--r I'm actually working on a small animation idea to test it out! Hopefully it'll lead to a bigger project once I have more time on my hands! ^^

It's that good thaat it crashed mah ipad

Enjoy :)
hey im thinking something in a similar style to this, was just wondering how you positioned the chain while animating? :)
@RyanDon for animating the chain I used five frame of morph targets/shape keys for an loopable animation.
First the chain mesh moves along a curve that I exported five frame of the chain mesh as MDD light point cache and re-imported the MDD in Blender.
It is the same workflow I have used for my animated ocean scene, just for a chain instead of an ocean.

Well done! Thank you for sharing the file!

For anyone on MacOS not able to uncompress the Hallwyl zip-files
(getting a no such file or directory error in Finder),
you might try this:

-1: rename the zip-file to e.g.:
ziptoberepaired.zip

-2: place ziptoberepaired.zip in your home folder
(same level as the Desktop and Documents folders)

-3: open Terminal.app
located in: 
>applications >utilities

-4: in the terminal-window, paste:
zip -F ziptoberepaired.zip --out hopefullyRepairedArchive.zip

and press return

-5: this will create a new zip-file in your home folder named:
hopefullyRepairedArchive.zip

-6: that zip-file should uncompress without problems
if it does not, try pasting:
zip -FF try.zip --out hopefullyRepairedArchive.zip
Again amaizing scan :)
Another fabulous model, gets my staff pick.
@alban Fantastic! Thanks a lot!! The same to @abbyec and @OVERHEAD for your feedback!!
@zenozenoplus1 Thank you! I don´t know the source of this problem I´m afraid. We use the uploader in Reality Capture. Nice of you to share! I hope this issue get resolved in the near future.
Model is voxelized when I open it in Unreal engine
Everything looks much worse in Unreal than here, I guess something is misising
This is amazing! definitely an inspiration piece of work. Well done.
This is wonderful! It satiates all my geeky longings; thank you.
thanks for sharing
Thank you.
ola meu nome é felipe estou aprendendo 3D tentando aprender sozinho estou baixando sua arte para aprender sobre referencias quando eu fizer algo legal terei o prazer de comunicar, parabens pela imagem estou aprendendo através de blender 3D acredito que de pra fazer muita coisa por la 



abraço brasileiro
@demolitor @demolitor you need to tweak some settings to get the expected result.if you can't let me know.I will try to help you step by step.
@mahedi91 hey thanks for helping me! What would be the steps? I have some experience with ue so just a brief 1-2 sentence will help a lot! Thanks!
@demolitor import the model. make the material with the map.set the value to unit you are done.no need to light.you will get the same result immidiately.

Storage: They really do look like little satchels and open in a unique way.
Upgrade Slots: Perfect spot  and Just seeing it and the storage here over the teasers are nicer.
Power Cell got moved back and can be empty?! Also is the propeller jet more defined or is that a boost upgrade on the back?
Lastly... ARE THOSE TOPEDOS?! Seriously can I take out a reaper with those?
Looks beautiful and torpedos oh yea I was excited
Sea Wars Episode II: Attack of the Reapers     :D
Yes!
thats absolutley amazing
Love it!
if you go inside the SeaMoth you si in the reflection a wall with a window and outside a tropical island: Why? Is it an easter egg?
I think the storage cases should be permanent features, not modules.
That image you are seeing on the glass inside the sub looks like a stone doorway arch from a coastal Mayan temple in South America.  Definitely not something that is coming to the game.
They should be a separate upgrade that doesn't take a slot but takes material to make it. that would be a better system.
@morte117 no they do that because its easier to render, they do that with the knife and the solar panels to, the solar panels just have clouds on them nothing else even if you go over it.
I'm gonna 1v1 a reaper with the torpedoes.
The reflection looks more like an ancient ruin.
can you please make him downloadable i realy want to 3d print it!!!!!
he what program do you use to make these??

Hi shaderbytes, check it out my original post, there I didi a mention for the original concept :)

http://antonioneves.deviantart.com/art/Medieval-brewery-509798715

Thanks!
That's right, the other model that looks similar to this is also inspired in the same concept. Antonio, perhaps you have mentioned that it was inspired by a concept in the description. Anyway, what a great work! I really like the additional details you included.. the really add to the concept!!
Hey Santiago, Firstly thanks for like it man! So, actually I mentioned the original auor of the concepts in my other websites. I did not the same here because there is a limit to comment here in sketchfab, that is why I did not the mention here haha... there is a link from my artstation if you want to see the complete post! Thanks man!
Personally I prefer this one to the first model posted by the other artist. The textures look well detailed, I like the grass.
And only 2.7K faces compared to the first 7K faces. Good job.
Hello Gesy, thanks for like! Actually I like both models, the mine and the other, both very well done, it is just a different style of painting and models. It is good to see the same models made by different artists! :)
Hey man, how did you UV/texture this piece? For e.g Did you first paint the textures and unwrap to them, or did you unwrap them uniquely and then painted all those wooden beams?
Hi Gesy,

Well... Firstly, I did all in separated pieces, than the UV and paint the textures for each one, in the end of all I did the unique model and unique texture... If you want to see the wips, in the description has the link to artstation and there find the link to the wips (36 images).
Ok nice I will check them out now.

I put it under architecture because the main usage of such assets is - as far as I can guess - for architectural visualization, to give a little bit of life to a matcap/prototype of a model...

You forgot that little button on the back. https://gyazo.com/6e797886f45f9234458db695037d07fc that one. Also the connectors are buttons themselves. Great job so far though.
wow!! awesome, if i had the model i would definitly 3d print it
Cool!

A note on the Dock. I think the indent in the back is for air ventilation, not cables! The air vents on the Tablet seem to be in the same area as where the indented place in the Dock is. 
I guess the HDMI and power plugs go near the USB-slots.
Nice job animating!

I'm willing to hand out the model so that others can import it to other games. Can you private message me about it? (I don't know if sketchfab has that feature).
what program do you use to make this
Blender 3D
can you make this as downloadable ?
@acegames I won't make this downloadable publicly, but I do let those who contact me privately the ability to download it. I don't think it best to share details on this forum, so we should probably find something else. Do you have a Deviant Art account?
@acegames Actually, go ahead and send me a request via my email: snipermaster7350@yahoo.com.
nice work. :D
Would be nice to see him in action.
Cool.
nice model.. i'm using blender as wel!!
Hi, do you sell them animated?
Love ur work?
Looks great! I have one question tho, when I Imported this to Blender I cant see the textures, only wire model, could you please explain me how to fix that? 

Thanks beforehand.
@mariotzu If the model is pink, you need to also apply the textures found in the package (I don't think it applies them automatically).
@dragon7350 Yep its pink and Im going nuts trying to add the texture haha

omg thats awsome!! do you know adding hairworks on 3d models?
Hi! Can we get it in a more universal format like obj or fbx?
Thank you in advance!
Omg, love it!

You also did a wonderful great job with the fur, that's so seamless and efficient!

I would also love to be able to get a copy in a more standard format, I'd love to see him in Unity (for personal enjoyment) :3
Thank you so much for this!! I used it ina Gotg trailer recreation which you can see here with all credit going to you in the description.

Hi,
I want to learn how to use Blender.
Is it possible to make a youtube tutoriel for Saturn with rings?

Nice Saturn depiction. Also, I just now learned from your description that ALT/option + left drag can change the lighting in most scenes unless they're using shadeless mode. Thanks!

@qknight  Thank you, I am glad to get comment for the first time.
Hand-painted textures are awesome! Love it so much :)
@yunxizheng Thanks a lot  :-)
Love it!!!
Thank you sir !!
awesome! What used software for texture?
@ETC_KRJP 
Thanks your comment !!

Base color is handpainted by Photoshop.
And other, AOmap and Nomal applied Diffusemap are baked to images by Substance .
Finaly these textures mixed to one image in photoshops layier tools.

Lets try to our best !
???????
@fl016 Thank you for reply, I want to know last one is How did you set up the Materiel? 

I'm using Maya and I'm working texture stage, but I'm stuck in the material set.

You know that? the MMD. I want to make like that.
@pyro789x 
???????????
@ETC_KRJP 
by the MMD, a toone shader?
I have never used Maya and MMD, so I cant maybe helpful.
How about try setting the ambient light and emissions strongly?
Thank you
I featured you on BlenderNation, enjoy :)

@bartv Thank you Mr !!
Very nice?
@Anlin Your profiles image is ! I like her same with you.
@fl016 oh,Blender! ok. I will start studying Blender.

Currently I have no plans to makes available for download this model.
If there are a lot of user who want it, I will confirm the terms of sketchfab and copyright, and then consider it.

Thank you
@fl016 
thank you for replying, wish you good luck!
may i ask to purchase this please? she is lovely. i would like to rig and animate.
@mynameisemery

Thank you @RaizVR This model was made from 1.958 images. They where shot using an array of four Panasonic GX8 cameras with 25 mm lenses (50 mm equiv) Exposure: 2s f5.6 ISO200. Pic of camera setup: https://goo.gl/ofQdtS

@TheHallwylMuseum I know you guys use RealityCapture but what are the specs on your rendering PC, if you don't mind my asking?
@teddytr Thanks for asking! Here is a link to the specs on our PC https://goo.gl/ymEmYD
Absolutely amazing.  For those of us with access to VR, I wonder if you could set the VR scale, as at the moment it shows as a rather large doll's house.  It would be great to get a feel of what it is like to be there.
@XMT Thanks for the reminder! How does it look now?
Absolutely stunning; can you do this with the other models.  Currently, I measure the chest at the top of the stairs at around 85 cm in the real world.
Hey, awesome work! It's possible to achieve the same result with just 1 camera (without the array)? Can you tell me the best method to capture those pictures along the room (angles, where to put the camera, etc)?
Thanks for your time!
@mamafeet  Thank you! Of course, you can get the same result with just one camera. It will just take more time to capture the images. I do not know if there is a best method but I usually begin in a corner of a room with the camera/cameras on a tripod at eye level height. I then shoot a few images across the room in different directions and then move the camera about 1,5 meters along the wall and repeat the process.

Once I´m back in the corner where I began I do two more laps. One as low, and one as high as my tripod will allow.
You will probably get an ok result from just the initial lap at eye level. The additional two will help your software to produce a more accurate model but will of course increase the processing time.
These are awesome! Thank you!!
Very beautiful model! Thank you!
thanks for sharing
This  work that went into this, once again than you for allowing the down load.
Amazing photogrammetry of interior architecture and pieces of art
This is wonderful model. Very, very nice. You are great. It's also nice to share the way the model was made. Thank you.

Bonjour Vincent, super modélisation. Je suis animateur 3D et cette pièce serait parfaite pour une petite animation que je fais. Est-ce que serait possible pour moi de l'utiliser?

Salut. Je n'ai jamais utilisé le format fbx. Je l'ai importé dans 3dmax et le modèle a perdu ses textures. Tu sais pourquoi? Merci.

It's really good but the nose looks too long. The model 3 nose looks a little bit stubbier.
Looks amazing!
As @jfact0ry mentioned the nose is a bit long and in the current prototypes there is another bar across the windscreen at the A pillar. Although I hope they remove it and go with this look! :O
Stunning! Did you create just the black one or did you create other colors too?
How to dowlad ?
Nice model ! 
I would like to use a Tesla 3 model to print it,  for my personal usage.
Would you let me download it please ?
Texture error bro!
@tomvanzummeren this model is now available for purchase.
@Crisanon Thanks for noticing the texture error. It's now fixed.

I think your mushroom has backward normals
@pndr I checked the model and the normals seem right to me. Anyway the mushroom has some problems at the bottom caused by the texture painting.
Thanks for your notice!

Don't you have the original texture, not the cartooned one?.

Thanks in advance.
@jorari71 Sorry, but that's the original texture.
Thank you anyway.  I was composing a scene in Unreal and need more shrubs and grass plants.
Love love love this. So much. I've been wanting make something like this for awhile, and I think I'm going to study your model and do it finally!

@denis_sd looks great in VR! Just a side note that I adjusted the scene's VR settings for proper scale and viewing, you can do it directly from the 3D settings.

Love how detailed this looks even though is pretty low poly, great texturing! love the style and character
I just started college on Monday.
My teacher had show this site when i asked recommendation about which site i can save future 3D Models.
Then he choose you 3D Model!! My first impression was that the palette of colors is one of the most basic, BUT you blew my mind with The Beauty of the colors and details.
SO congratulations ,man !! you are a FANTASTIC 3D Artist!!!
i am in awe of this
Beautiful textures dude.
@jamecz @zoging - Thanks guys, really happy you like it!
@DaviCarrijo - Haha man thank you, this is amazing to hear! That made my day :D
@phantom-fox - Thank you! There are so many wonderful examples of how well textures can be applied to low poly models. Final Fantasy XII was a big inspiration for my love of this style. Gorgeous texture work on very low poly models.
Congratulations! Our friends at CGChannel have featured your work on their site this month: http://www.cgchannel.com/2018/09/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-august-2018/
So cool

Hello there.  I just bought The Undead pack from UE4 marketplace.  Could someone tell me where to find literature explaining how to equip all the clothing on skeletal mesh.  I have been using UE4 for over a year but never had occasion  to add or research this feature.

Thanks,
Eddie
@Eddie.Brown.III We only create animated real time 3D characters. Blueprint and programing is pretty out of our jurisdiction... We set up a character blueprint with all the equipment on. Basically it's just a matter of deciding whether showing an element or not. We can only recommend jumping into the documentation and looking for potential tutorials or solution on the UE4 forum. 
We do hope you'll be able to take full advantage of this package. Sorry for not being extremely helpful.
Best regards,
No problem, thanks for the reply.

Eddie

Will it be available for sale or its a character you want to keep?
@BlackRott 
I'm sorry.
Since it is a company's work, it is necessary to adjust variously in order to sell it.
@Kokusho 
Thank you!
Well that's a shame. I was looking for a character similar to her. It would be nice if you can make a few changes and have her available for sale.
Wow.....bb
This is crazy. I'll be coming back to this one for reference. Really good work!

All of your models are stunning man. But the Sketchfab scene is always too dark if I may say. You should rethink the lighting of your models to show them off in a more suitable setting. 
God I'd like to be able to sculpt that good ! :)
@hansolocambo this account seems strange. all of the models have the same description and he doesn't seem to have a bio.
@captkiro his models are stunning in deviantart and look bad here. I just don't get it. When you're that good at modelling, turning on a light can't be that hard ?

@nickknacks thanks! Taking freakin eternity though to paint this, especially after my usual low poly stuff - really need to find some fast pipeline.

Hey, I removed the category Animals & Pets. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
@paulchambers3d OK. I replaced it by Characters & Creatures. Sounds more appropriate.
Thank you! All part of our current re-categorization initiative to make sure the Sketchfab community can more easily find your work!
Amazing work. How long did this take you?
@3dSwack Thanks. Took me around 30 to 40 hours.
Woah That Looks Awesome! Could You Create Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn?
i love this model would u like to tell me which tool did u used to make this and how did u learn to make a model like this.
@faizansohail49 I used CATIA V5 which is a CAD software I learned at school and I use at work. I make most of my new models on Blender though. I learned Blender alone with a bunch of tutorials and practice.
Nice work! :)
@iggy-design Thanks :)
trying to print this now but i cant figure out the scaling of each part. if i scaled on to 50 of the x axis the other parts dont match at a scale of 50. pls help
@Louis.Cook each part has to be printed at the same scale as the others. If you print a part at 50% scale, then you'll have to print all parts at the same scale.
Theo, does this model have multiple parts?  If so, how many?  Also, to achieve all colors how many different spools would a printer have to support.  The one I use can only support two different colors at a time.
Can you please make this model unposed?
@syskim81 it has been modeled in this pose and changing it would imply a lot of reworking. Sorry but I don't have time to do this.
null
@Gloomeskk 
i have started using blender
and i follow some youtube channels
like blender guru and cg cookie

can u tell which  tutorials did u follow
@faizansohail49 I mainly followed Blender Guru videos (he has great tutorials for beginners which came a few months after I started to use Blender). Then I just tried doing stuff by my own and this is how I learned.
@Gloomeskk 
can i contact you for some guidance

on fb etc.
@Gloomeskk 

i need a mentor

@katkat880 thanx!

@Bart, Wow! Thank you very much!!!
hello guys, i'm new here, can i ask what program you guys used to make this model????
awsome
kawaii ^^
This looks so cool and amazing! :)
How long did this model take?
@kashu thank you!

Oh, I don't remember how long it exactly take
@john_medved Your welcome :)
That's okay. Where did you learn to model like this? Self taught?
@kashu yes, self taught
hey, does anyone know how to enter into sketchfab in animated form particles in blender
Hey john I love your characters. Do you have a rigger or an animator? I want to animate these!
Interesting modeling eyes like that, im not familiar with this kind of stuff. Literally impressed, will try this method for eyes for my characters too!
Cute
Wow, you've reached 5000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

Great modeling and texturing for sure , the facial expression is a let down for me though, no matter which angle I look at it. its the mouth   ?

It's Not Yoda! This is not Yoda people, make no mistake. This is a Mandalorian city. And the character is not significant, so Favreau did not give it a name. Read Jon Favreau's opinion of this character in the Internet. Idiots. Of course, this model is easiest to call Yoda. It's not Yoda. And never will be. The creators respect the concept of a character. Don't care. Think when you name a 3d model.

Woah I love it so much :) Find it very cute and love the color scheme & lighting ! (you say it's too dark but i like the contrast between the 'sad' mindset of the broken soul & the bright encounter) It seems you struggled a lot to fix your mind about the final piece.. worth it ! ;)
@mrrik Thank you so much :D !! Yeah glad it's noticeable !!
@khea Yeah Thank you so much :D  !! Yeah cause it looks so simple but actually deciding on the minimal environment and this lighting took a lot, also the simple stuff like making the robot broken and him admiring something organic/different, and his chest is opened.

Very cool! Have you got a version of this model transformed into standing? I'm having a heck of a time figuring that out. Thanks!
@takeovertom Where it says Static pose, click and change it to Transform. Then hit the play button.
I just read the description (something I should do more often). I'm putting it in unity, that's probably my problem.
Congrats! It looks great.
This was amazing.  Very nice job
Really really great work, I love it...
April 2nd 2019 - Forewarning. I'll be removing this as a free download later today.
@METALGEARRAY  can you share this on sanwaldistrict@gmail.com
@sanny123 You could always ask me.
where is download?
@Daniel.Osvaldo I made a note about it in an above comment.
@METALGEARRAY   Is your Bumblebee able to transform too?
@FabStarbolt I seem to be a month too late :) Is there a way one could still obtain the model?

@jerbot In fact, I mainly work with the procedural tools in blender, like the voronoi texture on which I play with the settings to make reptiles' scales for exemple. 

I haven't got any video of my workflow, but you could find a overview of it, in this Sketchfab's spotlight in which I explain the way I've created my Liopleurodon : https://blog.sketchfab.com/art-spotlight-liopleurodon-ferox/

Mind adjusting the VR settings?
Very nice. What did you use for remeshing?
@araon this can be free Instant Meshes or any of popular skulpting tool that have quad retopo. But main rules for low poly models, edges of lowpoly model MUST follow major edges of high poly. But this is a big problem for all this quad auto retopo tools. Eyes, ears, tails. Yes, baked normal map can hide this mistakes, but in some angle you will see strange effects, where normal map show you one but shape of model another.

Main point for quad mesh is edge loops that allow better UV unwrap. Good UV can help you paint textures. But if you do not have plans paint textures or at least do not need fix in photoshop some texture errors, quad mesh and UV on it is not required. In this case, MeshLab quadric edge collapse decimation make better work with triangle polygons that better follow original topology.
@R0m1R great scan!
This statue looks big. Did you use drones for scan top of statue?
@alban Thx, yup VR setting updated, enjoy ;)
@araon I've used Zremesher from Zbrush and made some polygroups to get better UV.
@ssh4 Thx ! Nope, I just try to be far away to get the top but I can't fly drone in Paris ^^ btw most of the time I prefere to decimated and avoid using quad mesh that sometimes breaks the geometry . But when I need clean UV I prefer to have quad which are really usefull to find seams for quick unwrapping ;)
![UVt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1ctz9Rbcu2YYTcyTDgxbDRoU0E)
@R0m1R You should check 3D-Coat it have great UV path tool that help manually set patches or seams for triangle mesh (Blender or 3Dmax probably had similar tool). Not a automatic, but with UV relax it allow create good UV.
Very impressive ! Thanks !
@Vlad Thanks. I like 3D coat for re-meshing, exactly because it allows me to paint polyflow and even the automatic polyflow is not bad. 

R0m1R Cheers. Awesome scan.
Very cool scan. I remember seeing this statue in the movie Amélie :)
Super Scan !
Awesome job!
Amazing project !
Amazing model! it is a 3D scan or 3D sculpting?
@everyone ! thx for your kind words ;)

Yeah, not a full scale normal map, doesn't affect the hard edges.
Only the diffuse map and normal (rather, bump map) are hand-painted. The rest is generated by DDo.
This textures are perfect!
Great Job!
the design is really rad! of both!
Great work. You really know how to make the texture and normal map work for you. great job!

Nice work! However I cleaned up your categories a bit, see our guidelines:
https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines

Specifically I removed the Cultural Heritage & History category:
Objects, artifacts and visualisations directly related to the history of life on Earth and intended for the education and instruction of viewers in the field of cultural heritage.
Awesome.
All your models are amazing, thank you for making some available for dowload.
please post more models of famous anime ...
@www.wilian.figueiredo.t800x Of course, I will be making more Overlord characters in the future and have them available for download. Thank you for the comment.
Cool!
Holy damn, Nice work :D
How do I get this?
Really cool.
Thanks for sharing! :D
A very cool model, well done m8!
I am currently playing arround with unreal animations and stuff, if youd like i can send you something if i make something out of our epic overlord.
@kochsa Thank you.That sounds cool, but you can just post them on your profile. You don't have to send them to me.
Is it possible to make a T-pose version of this model. I would not mind paying for it either. Keep up the great work!
@sinisteraquario I'll think about making a T-pose and rigging this model. This one is not very suitable for a proper T-pose due to the shoulder pad armor and cape.
@GHPurple true, looks like it'll be a toughie
if its possible can you write to your shaders? :^3
@akibro Nope, I'm too stupid for that.
@GHPurple why? :D its looks like amazing
@akibro Thanks, but what are you referring to? I'm confused.
@GHPurple I would also pay for a T-pose version it looks so good well done.
wow
https://imgur.com/a/W8GExSR can you make this man? i will buy for sure
thanks, I am planning to put this in VR Chat.
hey, would you consider making a death knight?

I just discovered it after trying substance painter ( which has good features too ), but I think the system of texturing you've developped on 3D-Coat is better so far. And I feel very familiar with your soft as I like to work with photoshop too.

 Keep up the good work, I can't wait to see more ( as sketchfab team use to say ;) )

This is great! I really like how she kinda looks 2D.
Awesome!! Takes forever to load but worth it. :)
Hair and clothes are odd, though. Shadow maps didn´t load?

Wow, surprising, is a very good model but i don't like the style of the eyes... It don't care, so like.
Nice model also like the shining effect on clothes and the skin

This is really cool! :D

One possible issue: I think that the normal map for the earth's surface is inverted because the continents look like they're indented into the earth rather than protruding out. Maybe toggling the Flip green (-Y) setting in Sketchfab's 3D Settings will help.
@WildCat-Actual 

Thanks for the tip man. I had to invert the actual normal map tho. I generated it from images, so it isn't really accurate hehe.

I've also added an extra layer to the map baked from a displacement map. Hopefully it looks better now :)

Thank you for the feedback!
@hypersketch208 Thank you :)
@weimvi Thanks :D
looks like google Earth!
Incredible!
lets send it to Pres. Trump.
Maybe he will see how beautifull our earth is, and this model of course
@te3donie Uh doubt he would see that, but dont bring the politic  in here.
Like the animation of the clouds.  Yes, this is not scientifically accurate, but it looks nice.

Nice world Murilo! I borrowed it for a video on my new youtube channel here is a link to the video. https://youtu.be/ZcW8OGeQcJw I will leave a link to your Sketchfab account in the video description. Thanks for freely sharing your work!

thanks Best !
Excellent! Can I use this model for my project?
@korAPUcard It's under the CC attribution license, so legally yes you should be able to.
@bulletmaidengames Okay, Thanks!
@korAPUcard It's really important to know what ALL CC attributions do though as well. Below you can read each license provided for the model by clicking the blue learn more hyperlink.
@korAPUcard 

Hi korAPUcard, thanks

Sure, feel free to use it however you see fit :]
@bulletmaidengames 

Thanks for the help! :]
@murilo.kleine Np! Great work :)
Downloaded the model in gltf mode but it looks dark in the 3d Viewer or in gltf viewer. And just the clouds are showing when I increase the intensity of the lights. It looks way better on Sketchfab. Any ideas how to improve the looks in gltf?

@bartv Ok ;) thank you!
Whoops, I think I didn't actually click the 'staffpick' button. Here you go!
@bartv thanks, i appreciate it ?
Great scene - I love the attention to detail! :)
@nomadking thanks ?? I'm glade that you've noticed it ?
Stunning texture work here !
@gav.grant Thanks a lot :) i'm happy that you appreciate it ;)
Very well done! 

Just curious, but how many separate texture files did you end up with in a scene this large?
Amazing work ;)
@goldensun441 thanks, i did 2 texture: one for the house and one for the other elements (like trees,ground) ;)
@zak3d thank you! :)
how can i git it? may i? vzheng56@163.com

I hope I can see the object in STOVL mode, that's a great job either way. Like it
Blue sky in the background would be nice. Excellent work!
Hi, I'm going to build a simulator cockpit as a school thing / as a hobby. I wonder if you'd be willing to talk about the price or maybe provide it for free? I just need it for measurements.
@henrilavikainen the cockpit is available separately for cheaper (find it through my profile)

Thank you. I downloaded everything, convert FBX to OBJ, renamed JPEG to JPG, imported it into Bryce and visualize it. If I make a job out of these sticks, I'll post a link to the picture here.
I'm quite satisfied with the low polygonality of the models. It takes up little space in the memory and in the file.

@bartv Thank you, appreciated :)
Very nice concept and design. I like it a lot. But I think it lacks mechanic approach. Is this petrol or steam engine? Petrol tanks are present but this big engine is clearly steam powered. There is no throttle, no clutch and no gearbox so the bike goes straight by turning engine on. There are no bowdens for throttle, brake, clutch so the levers are there for nothing. Also there is a big brake disc on the rear but no caliper to actually brake it. How is the headlight powered? Is this a dynamo? If so it should be placed near the wheel rim.
null
@mahrcheen Thanks for the detailed comment! The concept was from Jordi Alcala as stated in the description, and I didn't really explore all the mechanical aspects, I just liked how it looks and I think Jordi did a great job on that part! I agree it would be better if it would be something that actually runs, but I didn't have the time for the extra effort :)
@svacomatija Hehe I get it. Sometimes I can get too technical about stuff I make and it actually is time consuming just to invent some way to make things believable .
null
damn sweet!
Very cool idea
Awesome model, thanks for making it downloadable, very helpful for me to learn, it would be nice to full scale print it and make a electric cycle out of it!!
@juane3d Thanks, glad it could be useful :)
This is amazing work!! I wanted to ask if the part are separate. If so, I plan on rigging it so it can completely usable.

Hey dude! Sweet model. I can't help but notice that it is version 2! Does that mean it was modeled after something in a game, movie,etc? Or did you model a version 1 of the messenger?
Cool!
Please consider releasing a character model set on Unreal Engine marketplace. Really need some kind of rigged Stealth characters for my game

@joel9533 @maxmorgan
May we know what 3D software you were using to open this file?
Maya and 3ds Max allows to read the first motion file only, while MotionBuilder or game engines like Unreal, Unity can play them all.
Hello there, Nice model u have there, I downloaded it but i couldn't find all the animations in the preview, and I really need it for this small project i'm working on, would it be possible if I get the rest of the animations?

Hey dude really cool design! I was wondering if I could ask. did you unwrap your model? and if so how do you do it so effectively. cause I'm struggling and I'm still learning.
@Tasty_looms Hello! Yes, I did unwrap it, but in the worst way possible hahaha! I used automatic and didnt even retopologized the mesh, the sake of this art was just for generating still images... Part of it you can see on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByuXa-eres&t=204s

Good studies! :)

Hello hisador.abramovitz, I will send you a copy asap, don't worry ? Good studies!
hey there  I am replying to to let you know that for some reason I did not get the model to study so could you plase send it again but try this e mail instead hisador.abramovitz@gmail.com
Hello I was wondering could you please resend me the file  I did not receive it yet

Amazing model,I must say,great work!
@deathwing1995 Thank you! I really appreciate it :)
I'm a programming student and I would love to use this for my game boss if only I know how to rig and animate him,such shame......still a pretty model to look at and I'm kinda impressed by the little amount of triangles it has for a fine model. Keep up the good work!
@deathwing1995 I'm glad you liked it. It wouldn't be easy to use it in a game, it would need to be reposed, retopologized, rerigged and retextured, so probably a lot of work still. The amount of polygon is from Blender's decimate modifier used after the high res sculpting. :)
Thanks, That's awesome 3d model. I have a problem. Can You help me? How to apply texture for 3d model for use 3d model viewing?

damn!!!

I know alot of people so will love at use this in VRchat

@newtondev Thanks mate, appreciate it ;)
This is amazing! I love it! Would you be willing to give me a quadrangulated t-pose version of this model so I can rig, and perhaps even animate it? I want to update my rigging reel and would like to use a creature like this one.

Looking forward to hearing back from you ? Thanks!
@gretchenasmar I'm glad you liked it, and I'd love o send you that version, but unfortunately, I don't have it because I sculpted the model and went directly to texturing and rigging, i never retopologized it, you can check most of the creation of it on the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByuXa-eres

Amazing !

I would love to be able to 3D print it on my 24x 24 x 24 machine.
Love it! Can I download it for personal use?
@vistaero Just made it available for download, go for it!
@jonlundy3d Thanks a lot! But I'm having an issue. When I import it to blender, nothing appears. Not even in the hierarchy. In Unity is being imported perfectly tho, but it's just one mesh so I want to separate the mesh in multiple pieces.
this model is very good to rotate and watch it on screen, but with downloaded model, there are no options to get any normal format (extension) in normal view (preview). also, no possibilities to use textures, except to apply them again. in fact, this is zero quality, waste of time, sorry.
3dmax, cinema4d, solidworks...or any normal format will be accepted...this is web preview only
null
@vistaero I imagine that has something to do with the fact that I uploaded the model as an FBX, which is specific to Autodesk software. I can send you an OBJ, you might have better luck with that. Also I believe Blender has an FBX importer, but I'm assuming you've already given that a go. :)
Hey,

Cool model! Is there any way the model could be like split up instead of the two side boosters and core booster are like in one model and not in multiple? Thanks!
Yes, please! separated parts! I tried to separate them but I'm a complete ignorant about 3d modeling. I can't do pretty much without being able to detach the boosters, the second stage and the fairing.
@jonlundy3d Yeah, it says that the version isn't compatible, or something. OBJ would work great, can you upload that? I didn't see it when I clicked download. I plan on creating some videos with it and will definitely give credit!
Thank youuu! :)
Thank you!  Working on a negative budget in the planetarium world... now if I could find the SpaceX launch facility at KSC!  LOL
Wow great model!
Great model!
can i download this?
Nice model. Is there any way to get the model?

I am your old fan! Waiting for a new job was very long, but it was worth it. Your new job is great! I adore you! =^_^=
Nice!
@kody3d there seems to be a bug that makes your model display without textures. We're investigating.
@bartv Fixed. Somehow textures become unused in material but they still was there.
Thanks guys! I'm grad that you like her :)

Another piece of awesome work by this guy :)
Nice work...lot of work...the subject ,the light...great work of 3D.
Sorry I failed the gratitude there!. did not mean to. of course, THANK YOU!!. This is an inexplicable work of art. I could not believe it was downloadable. let alone Free. It's art and generosity like yours that make any thing 3d what is. inspiring!

Hey, I removed the category Art & Abstract.

This is part of our category refresh, you can read about the update here:

https://blog.sketchfab.com/introducing-our-new-categories/

And view guidelines for each category here:

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines

Soon we will also limit each existing Sketchfab scene to one category, so pick your category carefully.
@bartv thanks you for updating my category in this scene.
It is cool that there are more categories now and I like the Idea of only one category per scene this makes everything more focused and easier for everyone because the category think is under heavy work in progress here on Sketchfab, so many changes all the time. 
Am not sure if I should start or wait to change all my categories until everything is chiseled in stone.
I'd wait a bit longer just to be 100% sure as you have quite a lot of models to update :-)
wow, amazing!

@Banof

The source files can be found in the Warframe Art Style guide. Here is the link:https://www.warframe.com/steamworkshop/help/

Take note that the diffuse texture does not come with colour, you'll have to assign the colours yourself using the Mat ID as masks.

Also they don't include the specular and roughness so you'll have to figure out where to get those :P
@malayayu 
Thanks. This is great information and I like the barbarian out of the game, but there are no textures and a generally vertical out somewhere

I tried to make a Eldar, but it was difficult
Cool style work!
Thanks. ;)
I really love this hair. Zbrush + Projection in Substance? Generators for painting? Amazing!
Nope, straight UVs and simple stripes in substance painter for the hair. No sculpt, no paint. ^^
Very nice.  Would like to have a copy of this one.
Thanks. ;)
For what purpose would you like to have this model ?
I like robots and cyborgs, but mostly I like the head on this one.  Reminds me of a sci-fi show I was when I was a kid.
I am trying to make a 3D live wallpaper using Wallpaper Engine for my own use. Would it be possible to share this masterpiece?
@anaslex029 

Sorry, it's not for share right now, but thanks for the kind words. ;)

nice work.

any chance to get the model?
(pure private use in table top simulator, still missing some nice models for my eldar army)
@Angzt Thanks for your comment. 

As I already said to others, it's not for share right now.

but how can do it? MagicalVoxel ?
woah, so nice.
I like this very much. Last night I gave MagicaVoxel my first go, and liked the results. I thought it'd be fun to upload here, but in the end, I must have done something wrong, for my 'baked' model from MagicaVoxel didn't seem to have any baked in lighting or material properties (metal/gloss, etc...). 
Did you need to bake this in an external program? 
Thanks!
Nice rendering and model !

Same problem as you @peter_turner , with Magicavoxel 0.97.2 . 

Any advice on how to bake in the lighting and material properties
Cool
Cool!Bug how to import this into unity? I mean making it look exactly the same in Unity ?
Nice! Thank you for great soft.
Very cool, it looks like a Lego sandcastle, and I mean that in a good way =0)

@alban Thanks for the tip! Just added the tags!:)
That's a dinosaur.
Absolutely adore the style.
I have been trying to figure out how to achieve a simple illustrative look in 3D like this in a game for a while now. I have never made the leap to try it because i just could visualize it in 3d dimensions, let alone actually know how to deliver on it. It looks like VR art might be an avenue I have to pursue. I promise not to copy your work but, damn, I hope you don't mind if I'm inspired by it!
Wow.. as a 2D artist now venturing into VR, THIS is exactly what I want to achieve. Great work. Do you still work like this?

Hi @bjporter, thank you for your comment ....yes agreed .... way too high for real time, but at least the option is there to decimate to whatever level of poly's you like :-)
Hi @maryata, thank you .. glad you like it :-)
great ¡¡¡ thanks you very much.
Hi @dfabula, thank you :-)
Nice. Shame it's not downloadable. I could use similar surface just now. :)
Hi @araon, thank you for your comment ... I have decided that I won't be using this model in the commercial sector .. as a result, I have activated the download option for you .... hope it proves useful :-)

It looks realy well done, good job.

Im just wondering what it would look like animated
Thanks @maximum_sky! I made an animation for the fire but at the time of the upload there was still a small bug with blend shape animations so I didn't upload the animated version. But I'll add it later on when everything's fixed.
Thought about animating the water as well but still not sure how to properly do it :D

Fabulous.
So beautiful!  Thank you for making this downloadable!
Beautiful!!!
Hey, I removed the categories Architecture and  Products & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
how do I download the model?
Hi @topohill1! Thanks for the interest but I don't offer it as downloadable at the moment.
do you do any tutorial?

Is everything in one texture page or did you use multiple, because the UV looks too complicated to be in one ?
@jhdcosta Yep, all in one UV. You'll notice that we use a lot of symmetric and duplicated parts, so fitting it all on a 4096x4096 or 8192x8192 square isn't all that hard :)
Great

@mergevr thank you for the feature!  :)
Wow!
awesome!!!
what did u used for texturing?
@pame_chavez 

Hey @pame_chavez i used a mixture of 3d coat for the base texture and photoshop for refining and adding additional details.
Hey, I added the category Places & scenes, and I removed the categories Animals & Creatures,  Architecture,  Characters and  Products & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
Wow, nice amount of lovely details.
Very cool work, love the goblin inflatable too ]:8D
So much to see, very cool!
v cool work
Hi royalshark,

Your Murloc Ship Wreck Shanty is really delicated!

I'm a web-developer from Taiwan. Could you share me your 3D files for my non-profit web board game?

If you are willing to share with me, I will note that this model is from artist royalshark in my game website.

Hoped for your feedback. My email is andy770921@yahoo.com.tw

Thank you

I remember the orange one, aswell. Not sure about the rest. Great collection, Bart. :)
@JuanG3D I annotated them for you!

I think I'll go and get some batteries tomorrow and play :)
Could even add playable link in each annotation:   http://www.pica-pic.com/

Annotations and links have been a great idea! :) Here you can find many other links (like Fire! or Mario Bros Game & Watch): http://www.handheld.remakes.org/online.php
@JuanG3D: nice, thanks! They didn't all work for me, but I added some more links.

Wow! Awesome collection! In Russia we had bootleg version of Catch the egg and i loved it =) Nice use of annotations btw. and overall idea of storing your mamories in 3d format is genius =D
Thanks @Tolst! It was a lot of fun to create the scene and I wasted quite some time playing the games %^)

Very cool, but somehow only the preview shows textures (at least in Safari for Mac). How can I turn them on in the realtime 3D viewer?
I think that's a bug - I sometimes have that in Safari too. I'll pass it on!

So does this only happen in Safari on this specific model for you, and not on other ones?
It's a consistent issue in Safari for Mac (El Capitan). I can't see any textures in the realtime view.
Ok, we're on it!
Cool! ?

Something I noticed, you wrote Ballonnen on the sign. I think that should be changed. Other than that, you did great!
only bad think i have to say is the eyes thats all i think is somthing that could inprove everything else is greate keep up the good work
I have a question.Are you going to release pcaks as in new and shiny pack and the old pack,then the two pests(Balloon Boy And the Puppet?)
He looks Scottish
if anyone says he spelt Balloon wrong he is from belgum if you look at his page
Even better than the one Maximo made on steam!
balonnen?
Balloon Bitch
Things that 16nis the twat fucked up about this 
1. SOMEONE ALREADY MADE THIS YOU TWAT
2. It fucking looks old and dustey does not fit the toy stayle you twat
3. the eyes look like they came out of my ass you twat
4. it fucking says balonnen its balloon you twat
5. maximo is better then you at making models you twat
6. your a fucking asshole for making smoke the bear delete the models even when he asked for permisson you mother FUCKING TWAT BITCH
7. the fucking hand hole where its holding the balloon is the wrong size you FUCKING TWAT
@funnystuff58 jesus christ man he is atleast making models for a really nice looking map
did anyone listen to my 1st comment? i said he spelt it Balonnen! cause he is from belgum if he was english it would instantly be called Balloons!
Hey the funnystuff how about you shut your fucking mouth and die
I revoke what I said. I hadn't realized he was from Belgium and that it was Dutch.
@thefunnystuff58
You need to shut your little pottymouth.
1. He's being paid to do it.
2. How so?
3. If they came out of your ass they'd be brown, idiot.
4. He's from Belgium, he wrote it in Dutch.
5. Everyone has opinions.
6. Smoke didn't ask permission. He said I6NIS inspired him.
7. No it isn't.
You need to learn words other than ass, twat, fuck, and bitch. 
Next time, maybe you should learn some grammar, words, realize people have opinions, and that you should go die in a hole.
One more thing, you try to do better.
No. Maximo is a brony who rigged the model, didn't make it. This is way better. Maximo's BB is gargantuan. Just saying, HAVE YOU LOOKED THROUGH HIS F^@#ING GMOD PHOTOS. I HAD TO BLEACH MY EYEBALLS!
AWWWWWWWWWWWW HOW CUTE LOOK AT ALLLLLLLLLLLL THE LITTLE BUTT HURT FANBOYS THEY DO NOTHING BUT SUCK 16NIS'S 3INCH COCK
@thefunnystuff58 obvious troll who wastes his time. Thefunnystuff58 has no friends, no family, and no social life... what an 8 yr old
OMYGOSH I REALLY HATE HIM SOOO MUCH!!!...But still a good replica in 3d:)
on the sign its supposed to say Balloons! but i'm sure you did not know that. maybe you could do a remake where the sign balloon boy is holding says Balloons!?
@toy_foxy hes from belgum its dutch -_-
Balloon boy is messed up the sign the moth isn't black inside that's it

I remark that the pose of this Napoléon statue is strikingly similar to Louis XIV in front of Palais of Versailles that I have uploaded here: https://sketchfab.com/models/1bd20459e5c642b695c20c68759200ef. I wonder if there is  any protocole to build that kind of statues in France.
It's possible : for example there's a specific meaning to the number of hooves resting on the ground (see annotation 12, that I've jsut added following this discussion), but I don't know of any other meaning, although here and there you can find strange things on statues which have symbolic meanings.
I would love to print out your models! Do you have any plans for making them available for download - whether for free or for a fee?
excellent example of 3d scanning and annotations!
Awesome job!
great
This is just amazing! We use laser scanning to document heritage sites in South Africa but battle to get this level of detail. Can I ask what scanner and software do you used to create this wonderful model?
I don't use a scanner but instead  Nikon camera + nikon lenses + acute3D software + care and experience to put all these together. End users tell me that the price is much lower than that of laser scanner techniques. Please feel free to continue this discussion by e-mail if you wish (my contact is on my profile page)
Absolutely stunning scan!
I use a similar method for recreating sculptures, but I use Agisoft Photoscan Pro. Clearly I have a long ways to go perfecting my photography to achieve the level of detail and clarity that your model has. Your model is simply stunning!
Hi Gerpho, great scan! Do you have any plans to make this downloadable?
Thanks @bushey  
I'm sorry, but the end user doesn't allow me to make it downloadlble
Hi Gerpho, how many images did you take to create this fantastic model?
I really need this for my private project :(
It's amazing! How many pictures did you need to make this model?
Very amazing. Is ot possible to download this sculpture ?
amizing!! so much...congratulations!!
wonderful
Very good model!!
Hey, I added the category People, and I removed the categories Architecture and  Science & Technology. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
it looks like some birds took a shit on his hand
That wouldn't surprise me at all.
 In fact, I made this 3D model for the french company Socra before they dismantled it to retore it. And since there were quite a few holes in the bronze surface, they found lots of things inside, including a bird's nest !!
it looks great, very detail.

Sure thing, here's the link:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/150286/tmp/Sketchfab/DinoBox%20Photos.zip

I've also noticed some gaps in this model that aren't present in the original. We're looking into it..
Turned out there's something in the Blender uploader script that creates these gaps. I re-uploaded the model as OBJ and now it's fine.
perhaps you should take more photos the outside of the box to avoid gaps.
It's about the inside of the box :)

@R0m1R thanks :)

@dopepope thanks!
This brings back childhood memories! God I can almost smell them
Nice job. It would be great to see some Sketchfab tutorials on using the Agisoft programs to get clean results like this.
This was actually done in the free version of Autodesk Recap 360 :)

Here's a tutorial that's not specific for any kind of software, but which DOES help you prepare your project:

http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/121838008009/how-to-set-up-a-successful-photogrammetry-project
Perfect Scan. 

download files must be changed to see the textures. But after this it works very well with c4d.
What did you need to change? It loads fine into Blender and Meshlab here.
Hello Bart,

I did sent some e-mails to you. Why didn't you answer?
Hmm, when did you send them? I just returned from vacation :)
I did send one to 'notifications@sketchfab.com' on Fr 24.07.2015 10:47

with the headline AW: We miss you vlbehrens.

And another to 'hello@sketchfab.com on Mi 22.07.2015 17:48

with the headline My new model is ready.

Both as answer from your mail from Mo 20.07.2015 6:51 with the headline We miss you vlbehrens. And both with the first line Hello Bart.

It would be nice to hear from you.

Best

Volker

Really good work.I like the bark texture, maybe turn off the hdri from displaying that'll pop up the texture IMO. how did you make those fireflies glow tho ?
@umer.memon thanks! There is a bloom option under post-processing settings for emissive textures.
@tiffanychu Oh Ok. . Ive been using bloom without emission mats. :P Thanks
Love the engraved initial detail, the hand painting, and of course the glow :)

@FilipAAOfficial he said its not his model, so maybe no need for credit

Hey, I LOVE this. Would you please tell me what design you use?
@MaxAttackhero thanks for your comment! I am using Maya for modeling, Marmoset for baking and Substance Painter to texture.

Basicly I have this workflow:

Very cool! I cleaned up your categories a bit, see our guidelines:

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines
@seori Thanks so much for helping me out!
Interesting thumbnail, makes it stand out from other gun models!
I love how clean that model is! It is highly accurate and your use of mesh smoke and particles really makes everything pop. Most gun models are not this exciting to look at. Props to you dude.
@wburton95 appreciate your feedback very much! I try to put a certain character to my guns and always make sure it's not just some boring default gun to look at. ( usual the AA 12 isn't too fancy in general )
Hello iammalte,

I can ask, how does that smoke and particles add?

It looks very good, great job :)
@Canary Games Hi, I added this smoke and particles by a black and white mask as addition opacity! Glad you like it :)
Very cool! Just missing the primer strikes on the spent shells ;) Are those particles made with a mesh, opacity and emissive? Or lights?
@Brandon.Dearlove Thanks for your feedback! Making particles with lights wouldn´t be very performant. I used meshes and emissive.
That looks awesoome! any chance you can tell me how you did the particle effects :D
@skaveria of course. effects were done with simple meshes and a additive texture.

I can literally hear the TOOF TOOF TOOF TOOF TOOF TOOF TOOF
Made very cool!! But the shell has a whole capsule?)
@mvavaev Thanks for the feedback. I don´t really get it what do you mean by the shell has a whole capsule?
@iammalte  The shot is made, and the cartridge case is not punched from behind. It doesn't spoil the overall look. I just look at it)
haha okay

Fabulous....never watched something similar to this!
I like the amber material with the 'flecks'. How was that done? 

Also, is the shadow baked, or real-time?
flecks are triangles, check the wireframe view.
Shadow is realtime for the mosquito, the ground shadow is baked though.
I vote whoa! too. Nice work.

You're welcome.
I struggle do to normalmaps on low poly stuff, and yours is fantastic, do you have a work in progress of this model somewhere I could look at ?
stunning!

I am so grad to hear that .
My model does not know how much help, but I will be prepared to open the data in the near future some means.

This is stunning !

Maybe a bit too sexualised, but the mechanical parts are perfect !
Your work is really fantastic. Looking forward to seeing more. :D

@longfreeman 
Thanks!
OMG this stuff is to damn good...
btw how long you need to finish this stuff ?  and what software you use is it zbrush?
@arnoldrui 
Thank you for your comment!

I think it took about 10 days.
(Since using the holiday, completion of the model was late...)

Although I'm using basically MayaLT.
Body, face and hair are using Mudbox.
What anime is she from? Great modeling!
@3dcinetv 
I am sorry to have to be expected, it is the original work...
Thank you for your comment!
In russina lang all female second names must be finished on A. So it must be Irena Zajtseva (^____^)
Nice model btw
@slozhny
Oh...I learned a lot (+_+)
I was immediately fix the name.
Thanks for pointing out!
Nice model the weapons have a large amount of detail put into them and also nice particle effects on the shattering glass kind of effect, how did you give the weapons and shattered pieces the reflection effect?
[Update]

Thanks for looking my models.
I've adjusted the following points...

-Ready for VR (I've checked at Gear VR.)

-Environment Color
-Some Material colors

Have fun!
Awesome design language. Really dig your style.

@ajgramling Thank you! Yes we did. The rig is not that compilcated. It´s all off the shelf parts. The cameras are triggered simultaneously with a wireless remote linked to four identical recievers.

Hi, and thank you for sharing this, they are all stunning.

Just wondering if it's possible to use the floor plans please?
@chrisbitoy Thank you! The 1447 images took around 3 hours to capture. According to Reality Capture´s log it took 30 hours to complete the model and texture. It was another couple of hours in Sketchfab´s 3D settings to add the annotations.
@ARpop Sharing is caring!
@tigerchips Thank you! Yes, of course you can! The original plans for the house was digitized a few years ago. You can view and download them on Wikimedia Commons: https://goo.gl/SgDhcx They are all free to use under the CC BY-SA license.
@TheHallwylMuseum Thank you.
Thank you, this form of 3D, is very useful in allowing people to visit places that they may never be able to do in person.
Great Model Can i use it in my project ?

Congratulations! Our friends at CGChannel have featured your work on their site this month: http://www.cgchannel.com/2019/03/sketchfabs-models-of-the-month-february-2019/
Pretty cool - although I'd suggest for the walk animation changing the timing on the opposing legs slightly so they don't land on the ground at the exact same time. Same for the running - a little offset would go a long way to make this look less mechanical.

Other than that, great stuff. The colors and textures are excellent!

Thanks, guys! :)
Wonderfull! Very realistic!
What did you use for post processing/ creating the wing material? Also is the paint on the wings removable or is it a destructive process?
Hey @tinyruin 
Photoshop and substance painter for the wings! A bit of manual painting was involved as well. 
In theory, the paint is removable, though we have never bothered removing it - it just looks so much better this way! :)
here is our website and your model promoted thanks

The resolution of your insect scans is incredible!
@mschuetz 
Thank you! :)
Beautiful
Beautiful overall, but especially the wings. Do you automate the focus stacking? If so, what do you use? I assume the 95 images was after reducing each stack, correct?
@ARC-3D  Thanks!
At the time it was a semi-manual stacking using Helicon Remote/Focus. Somewhere around an average of 10 images per stack. 
Currently we are working on a fully automated solution - rigsters.com/arago
Amazing scan, splendid lighting, and a very nice use of materials ?
I would give it a second StaffPick if there was such a thing !

ahh so cool!
This is so awesome
Thank you so much, folks! It means a lot. Great to finally add something to this site. Now back to perusing your amazing works! :)
how do i download these?
@Goldenfox2019 These are my personal models, so I didn't make them available for download. Thank you for your interest, though!
@didisenpai I made this and Rose from scratch using reference images and incorporating my own style.
how to download?
This model is just amazing! You are extremely talented~
I would love to make a few custom modifications to add my own little flair to your model and show it off in VRChat =) 
That said I plan to make my own attempt at creating a Ruby model, tho I have no experience with 3D modeling ;D
almost good but face is bad
Every thing prefect but the face make her a little bit old
can this be downloaded?
very nice

Thanks guys for the comments and about the video link, I think it is a way to pay back all the things I have learned from other artists out there. After the holidays I will work on a more extensive version with subtitles and  more detailed steps to make this model, so stay tunned to my youtube channel. Thanks again and regards from Colombia.
Nice job Alzarac :)
Create some classic helmet from 4-5-6 episodes. -)
Where can I get plan's to make a Storm trooper helmet please?
Hi guys, in case you want to know where can you find the blueprints to modeling this helmet, here they are : http://www.anovos.com/collections/star-wars/products/star-wars-first-order-stormtrooper-helmet-accessory-standard-line-pre-order
sooo shiny and smoooth ... i wanna touch it
@FilipAAOfficial Hi Filip, you can purchase the 3d model directly from Turbosquid and you could use it on your project if you like it ( Read the license first to see if it fits your needs), about crediting myself as the autor of the 3d model, it is up to you and sounds good, but remember that this model belongs to the Star wars franchise, so you should be carefully about how you will going to use it to avoid any legal issue.

Best regards, 

Juan.

@Kahnha.Framko.Ioshoa mostly Blender, Substance Painter and 3DCoat.

you are very good. Love the little critters you made too
No link for purchase or download
I'm looking to create a similar model with lungs. How did you make the brain transparent?
@neurosimcore sketchfab has the inbuilt feature to make models transparent. You just have to play with the alpha settings within the material options.
How were you able to make only part of the model transparent? I have not been able to upload multiple files to the same scene to change specific parts. Thanks
can we download this

I tried to see what is under water! it scared me
do you rig all your models? i'm guessing if you use rigify it'd be easy to do so repeatedly and then you could reuse the rigs, but i was wondering if you always rig the models or model to the a stationary pose? could you give an example of a work you did where it wasn't rigged?

dude! this is amazing!
wow! i so love it, im inspired right now
Wow! Just, wow!
Astonishing stuff mate!
I'm a newbie when it's about handpainted and 3D, but i have a question, why does the shadeless look SO different from the Lit version, that's the first model that i saw such a increase in details and apparence from both versions, could anyone answer me? Sorry if it's a stupid question, like i said, newbie.
@tsunii Hi. Shadeless on here probably means just showing the diffuse/albedo map which is only 1 of the maps used to create the textures on the model. It uses diffuse/albedo, normal map, roughness map and specular map. These combined give you all the height detail and reflection detail on the models. Shadeless only displays one of those that's why it looks flat and non reflective. It also turns off the light.
@TOBSn08 Oh ty for the answer, didn't know that existed so many maps. Gonna read about those, by the way, didn't say but really nice work there :3
Awesome!
great!
Amazing Artwork!!

@FilipAAOfficial I've enabled download for you. No need for credit. This thing is hardly credible. The rig on it is sort of basic compared to what I have done in the meantime, but I won't be uploading the Inverse Kinematics version here. Have fun.
@SmeagolGollum Can you upload the texture file as well? I am throwing together a little fan made trailer for a project in class and I wanted to use battle droids. I can work with anything in maya and I already converted the blender file so if you could upload the texture in a .jpg or .png that would be awesome. I will credit you to be sure, but I need to know soon if you can do this because if not I will look quickly for another model I can use for the project. We are allowed to use any models online that we find so if you can't please refer me to other free models that you might of seen that are of fair quality. Thank you

Which modeling software did you use?
@knskan3 He probably uses Zbrush so that he can get all of the fine details.
Awesome!
That's great! I'm staff picking it :)
Looks like a great little hero :) 
Looking forward to the final scene

nice peace of art! Congrats!

Nice
Nice touch with the extra, inverted polys on the nose to add some definition on 3/4 views! Excellent! :D

I just started a low poly thread on the forum, feel free to add your model:

http://forum.sketchfab.com/t/low-poly-lovers/169/5

See you there :)
It looks so great with such few polies. :)
The only thing is that the trigger has a black background instead of a transparent one. Not to undermine your good work but I thought I'd point it out.
i liek it

thanks guys!! this means a lot :)
This is so cool! I'm fan boying r
This is so cool!D I'm fan boying right now.
haha glad you like it :D
your welcome
how long it take you?
well i didn't really take note of the time spent, i just took my time, but lets say a couple hours everyday during my free time, it took me around 3-4 weeks, that includes, modeling, texturing, rigging and posing.
:)
yeah i just posted something but it sucks hard. :|
haha you know what they say, practise makes perfect. Just keep going at it :)
thanks i just made something else if you want to see.
also i don't have a fast computer and time to work on them so. lol
It's going to be awkward when Cloud makes it to the lifestream.

So Zack... I'm sorry for 

getting you killed, 
stealing your sword, 
stealing your identity, 
stealing your girlfriend,
hooking up with your girlfriend,
asking her to join a whore house, 
beating her up, 
allowing her to get killed, 
... Did I mention I stole your sword? 


God I love that game.
Hahha it's one big heist! Yeah FF VII is awesome :)

incrível ?????
@recarte Valeeu Recarte! Um projeto é muito motivante para aprender coisas novas! O quanto eu já não fucei para fazer as coisas de StrawberryWarriors OUEHoaue... Manda ver! \o\
@brunorockshooter Obrigado Bruno! :))
@YasminDigitalArt Valeeeu Yasmin! :)
@brunosobhie Valeeu cara! :D Me esforcei muito nesse, e estranhamente e nesses projetos que ficamos mais nervosos né? Mas tá funcionando! haha
@brushrush Acompanhei strawberry desde o comecinho e foi legal ver o aprendizado. Recentemente fiz um concept de personagem graças aquele desagio personagens para um jogo. Aprendi bastante, vi onde errei e agora tentando aplicar nesse novo, mas mesmo assim fiquei muito feliz de ter terminado
@brushrush Gui, uma coisa é certa, quanto mais a gente está com medo do processo, ou quanto mais nervoso a gente fica, mais gratificante é o resultado final e mais satisfeitos com o nosso desempenho ficamos, é diretamente proporcional, da mesma forma que quando temos uma expectativa muito alta acerca de um filme, por melhor que ele seja, nossa hype nunca vai ser superada, agora quando não esperamos muito e o filme nos surpreende, a sensação é maravilhosa! De qualquer forma, vamos continuar criando pois é essa sensação que nos move e nos faz querer melhorar cada dia mais!

Parabéns pelo trabalho, tem sido uma experiência única acompanhar esse projeto e aprender junto com vc os desafios do mundo da pintura e do mundo em 3D.

nice.. does that mean there's a NSFW version lol
@equus.0000 totally!. Though sketchfab doesn't allow to even show genitals anymore. So I had to remove many of my models and stop using sketchfab as my 3D hosting service. There's a lot of newer models you can find in my other galleries or kreic3d.com , as well as other versions that were removed from this site and even a model store for VRChat avatars
@kreic I found, and bought! Thank you! ;)

Really love your work. Did you know we launched a new version of the Unity Exporter? It should be more robust and reliable. Would love to get your feedback!

Hello @james 

I have just tried the new version and upload this https://sketchfab.com/models/4d3de72fb9dd4907a8c190afd98aa01a
The material import option is awesome! Thanks for the great work, it really saves my time. Also the replace file option would be much apprecieted, but I don't know if that could work.

 I guess I will have to go to the 5.5 unity version now :)
Awesome :D

I'd love to get re-upload features in all our exporters. One day...
that statue is awesome !!!
Excellent work!

I am looking for a person with your skills to make artwork for a card game.

If you are interested please email at drawcodegames@gmail.com with the following info.

- Estimated Cost for project below

- Email to contact

- Availability

Here's the gist:

The design should feel like playing cards at a friend's place.

- Skybox of friendly card room (open to room)

- Table in the middle could be anywhere from poker table to small table.

- Cards would be floating in front of table and on table (I can provide textures for the cards, would like to see cards flat on table and floating as if a player is playing

- in the room would like either a trophy case or leader board, which can be 2d with a 3d feel. The concept would be user clicks on it and menu pops up

- Simple menu/button that fits the feel of the rest of the design

The main difficulty would be making the design user friendly. I have concepts but would need a few sketches before making the final assets.

//Picture concept dropbox.com/s/zqddtmzgis4di0y/af3130790fbd3c16_6074-w500-h400-b0-p0--beach-style-family-room.jpg?dl=0

what is the price or how do I get it?
it would be nice to get these pose as a obj file to print it on my 3d printer
@shergero Hi, here you can find it https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6ADRW
@chroschi Hi Chroschi, soon I post the model in https://cubebrush.co/cgmakers
You can find some of my .obj models available for download. Please send me some pictuares when you print some one, that will be amazing!!
Great work!!
@shergero @shergero Soon I will post it for download, the price will be 9.9 US
Love it <3
Hi, i just purchased this model and i expected it to have textures as it's shown in the viewport.
Also, as it's not rigged, i expected it to be in a T pose... is there any chance to get the textures and the model in a T pose? if not, is there any way to get a refound? i wanted to rig the character myself so i can make some posters and wallpapers :(
How is this somehow better than the one in game?
Hi, @cloud.cgmakers I bought this model I think include texture file... Preview model painted texture... Can I get mtl file for texture?

is it possible to give it more feather animation?? like individual feathers?
@Rin-Fluffy-Girl No sorry. It's not possible. The way this model is designed is for background element. Adding support for individual feathers would be a performance killer for real time projects.
Love your Animation, would like to purchase but want to know if .fbx can be brought into 3DS Max. I have an older version 2013 with the animation?
@paul.siemms Thanks for your interest. The fbx should import just fine inside of 3Ds Max 2013. If you encounter any issue, just contact us and we'd reexport to a more compatible version.
@protofactor I see! Well it looks absolutely amazing.
hallo 
I downloaded the eagle but it is not animated please how do you help me?
@tirane thanks for your support! Hard to help you with such a limited amount of information. Can you please reach out to us directly via email so that we can make the support process easier? Make sure to import the Eagle@AllAnimation.fbx. This version has all the animations on a single timeline. You also have a .txt file telling yo uwhich frames are part of which animation. If you haven't do so yet, make sure to download the .rar archive file where all is included. If you need any further support. Contact us through email.
Sincerely,
@protofactor
 I downloaded it from zipp Eagle@AllAnimation.fbx. In LUMION. nothing goes wrong. can you give me again in an animation format?
@tirane Hello Tirane,

Not sure to understand. You said nothing goes wrong. Do you mean that you issue is solved now? Please contact us through email so that we can offer a better support. Thanks
Does the eagle animate in maya 2018?
@Ahmed.Eid Hello and thanks for your interest. Since Maya supports FBX import / export, you shouldn't have any issue importing the model inside Maya.
I need to make eagle animation as a loop animation. 
So i’m asking about animation format, if it comes with key frames or baked animation.
@Ahmed.Eid you'll have an FBX file, With all the animations in the same timeline (and a .txt file listing all animations with their start and end frames) . Not sure what baked means since this is more of a Maya specific terminology. You should end up having a key per bone and per frame.

@edoardogalati could you post a message about that on our Support forum? We'll gladly help you out :) 

http://forum.sketchfab.com/c/support
@bartv  Thanks very much for the recommendation, I'm so happy and looking forward to start my next project. :)

@edoardogalati The sketchfab forum is a great place to get help and solutions quickly. Maybe you may wanna play around with the transparency, roughness, metalness settings in the material tab, that's how I got it for the  light bulbs.

@ytokan  Thanks, that's a funny one. :)

@yaldroid I love your bathroom and living room works, the textures and bakings are so well done.
The photos were taken when I was in Hong Kong for a holiday. Lots of good memories there esp the desserts... yummy....

@christopher.gauge  Sorry, my works aren't for distribution at the moment.
Thank you happs for like to my works and the food in HongKong~
I am trying my best to sell sketchfab interactive scene service to my potential client.. but not success at all.. hmm.. 
I may need to create more and more scene with advanced skill like PBR, and your texture setting and modelling are really perfect.. that's great! If I could create the work like you did, my client may then accept this service.. but it's hard for me...

Looking forward to see more your stunning work, and thank you for sharing !
@elsielph I just featured you on BlenderNation too :)

Thank you Bart! I hope to start my next experiment soon. :)
Awesome²
@www.omega2k.de : Thanks! :D
How did you archive this lighting and glow effects?
@www.omega2k.de: I baked the lighting into the textures and used the bloom effects from Sketchfab (post processing tab).
Hi. I wonder if you could tell me how to hide the walls and ceiling when you move the view, please.
Hi sandrasnchs, as my walls and ceilings are planes, so in the sketchfab material setting, i set the  face rendering option to single side. hope it helps ..

@Mandy1902 thank you)
I love this kind of work, that's good, good job!
Looking awesome, how did you apply the colour, is it UV unwrap or just adding material colour to the faces?
I'd like to imagine this is the actual layout for a house, and the occupant has to climb up the walls and jump down from room to room to get anywhere.
Give me a ladder~2333
@lkjklkjh haha talk about build exercise into your environment. want to relax and watch TV? Enjoy the climb.

Good job but I think a little too much points. I'm wating for a next cool work.

Really Great work, a bit to high poly on most areas, especially if going for the anime look.
But i can't argue with the end result.
@dark-minaz thank you, yes i didn't do the retopology, but this model isn't for animation. I changed some volumes and have prepared for printing.
KevinKeiwart what is the name of the tool you used to create this model?
@sonicblast06  Zbrush!
love... love... love... this. is there anyway you could convert this to 
and STL or OBJ format so i can 3d print this?
@vick54  I can prepare this to print, but not for free! hahah

Hello franzbrand100. Great that it worked on your smartphone!
Which operating system, what browser and which version did you use there?
There are some known issues with download on some browsers/machines. It's usually related to network issues.

Hey, I added the category News & Politics, and I removed the categories Architecture,  Cultural Heritage & History and  Places & Travel. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
while its cool and all that, the initial overview looks ok, but any kind of decent inspection reveals that the data is highly compromised, and effectively useless. 
The actual video would be far more more useful.

This is an amazing scan, what did you use for the photogrammetry?
PhotpScan y Blender.
Did you have used a drone to have the top of the Dolmen ?
Or just a camera and a pole
Se trata de una estructura megalítica con una altura máxima de 1,70 metros, por lo que no he utilizado ni dron, ni pértiga... he tomado las imágenes de las piedras superiores levantando la cámara fotográfica. con mis brazos.
this is so good :) grat work. I hope to see more dolmens like this
Drago, estoy trabajando para poder mostraros otros ejemplos de estas hermosas estructuras megalíticas. Un saludo compañero.
Fala Raul, Great 3D photoscan, well done.  I just imported into VRED for a panoramic render that puts these rocks in Rio de Janeiro at sunrise.  https://twitter.com/Tojek_VFX/status/556934265641119744
Hi Raul,

Excelente trabajo Joe.
This is amazing scan! Thanks for sharing :)
Como os ha gustado el scan 3D del dolmen de la Pedra Gentil, voy a modificar su textura por una imagen tratada por un software especializado en la identificación de pinturas rupestres. Ahora podemos ver unos grafitis hechos sobre la roca que antes no podíamos ver a simple vista.
Yes, very realistic! Thanks for this!
Magical. This is exactly what photogrammetry is about. Many thanks for sharing.
Gracias compañeros por vuestras palabras.

Perfecto. Muy buen modelo.
Gracias compañero.
Realy good 3D scan. Thanks for sharing it with us : ).
Me encanta el modelo! Gran trabajo.
Hice una pequeña prueba bastante mejorable de visualización en tiempo real y generé un video 360 para probar.

Congratulations, Polycount just featured you as one of their favorite artworks on Sketchfab in December! http://polycount.com/discussion/181115/sketchfab-spotlight-december-2016
@paulchambers3d, Thank you! Surprised!
Awesome, could you make this downloadable as an STL or OBJ file? I'd love to 3d print this.
???????!
@rediraevac The original high polygonal mesh looks completely different, it does not have small details of the relief, including patterns, it looks like a base model and it's unlikely you'll like it. All the small ones were made in Substance. Moreover, the preparation for printing is a laborious process. It is necessary to completely remeshing the details and you will have to make connecting pins. I do not know this now, I'm doing game models. So sorry =)
@beatheart ???????!
WOW!
Dude it`s wonderful!
lovely
Amazing!

This is brilliant! The ONLY thing I would change is the name from Night Quartet to Midnight Quartet. I think it has a better ring to it, and it also has 4 syllables. But if this is from something disregard what I said.
Would you be willing to make this downloadable? I'm modeling a female pirate and would love to use this.

@comatos Thanks :) it was a bit difficult to figure out how to set up 40 shape keys in one scene, I'm glad that it looks like in Blender :)
I can help with that ;). 
In blender you have option to export to Lightwave Point Cache *.mdd, exporting animation to this format change every animation, bone,sim, pose etc into point cache aka shape keys ;).
After exporting You simply copy animated object and apply subdivision if you use this (the vertex count must be final) and import *.mdd now you have full animation in animated shape keys ;).
This works for me almost in 99% cases.
@KrzysztofZwolinski Wow what a awesome trick, Thanks!
I wish I had known this earlier, It's really a timesaver! 
And it is possible to convert all kinds of modifier based animations to shape keys per frame, cool!
Wow, awesome ocean effect Dennis! I think that's the first time I see something like that here on Sketchfab. Staff picked :)
Yes you only need to setup quality/frame rate. 
!Remember after import the data is added to selected object that's why you have to copy original one and make pure static vertex mesh without animation, drivers, delete armature weight groups etc  ;).
This one is awesome, 
Great Job.
Did you sculpted each frame/shapekey by hand or you just simulated it? Wow.
@bartv Thanks :) activated by the use of an animated ocean modifier! I will try some other modifiers to see what else is possible :)
@KrzysztofZwolinski Thanks, it's really interesting, and I see a lot of animation possibilities with this method :)
@diogosoares Thanks :)
@redy Sculpting each frame by hand would take too long I think.
I used an animated ocean modifier and some shrinkwrap modifiers to generate the shape keys for the animation.
It is too complex to explain it understandable a few sentences, I will make a tutorial about.

@timothyahene Thank you!
Super nice work! Staff Pick.
@nebulousflynn Thank you so much!
Amazingly good
How can I get this amazing model? Someone answered me?
@wu688338 I am not sure if I have the right to distribute this model at the moment, but I will check for that.
Excellent  look and feel. Post similar Great products Mikhail.. ?
Congrats...Great work...!!!! I'm curious to know if it is made from real object or it is virtually developed? If from real object, then how did you managed to deal with shininess and lower part of the shoes, and how did you add the texture and shininess again? I'll be very glad to know as soon as possible... ?
@_ChintaN_ Hi! This one was made from scratch using a lot of references so it was easy to control properties of each material type.
Ohh Great..that's truly awesome
hola amigos!!!! que buen trabajo!!! alguien me podria decir como se hace para que me salga la suela!, me compre una base giratoria! y me llega en unos dias! para hacer foto en 360 estoy OK, pero para que se vea desde abajo o desde arriba! no logro dar con quien lo explique, gracias saludos, dejo mi email info@kandil.com.ar   Ricardo

Great job, my Gramps used to build these in Illinois, La Grange plant. I used to replicate the drawings in his photos and scrap books but this is unimagined by them.
its nice and its free??
Hi, this model is fantastic! Are you familiar with the game Transport Fever? I am looking for someone to make models for the game and of course it would be a commission basis. but my current designer is busy with other commissions and my requested work has been put on hold for a while now
We’d be working with Bugatti the race car manufacturer - so it should be a great experience
I like your work, I’d like to talk to you about working together. My email is LToddMorelli@yahoo.com

Todd
Very nice! But where can I buy it (or get it as a free-mod)!

How did you do this?
@pepperary, I did this in 3ds max with blueprints and rendered it here on Sketchfab :)
Nicely built model :)
Thanks :D
Maybe turn up the intensity of the light from the enviroment a bit, then add in some contrast in camera effects ;) Would help to show some of the really great detail
Jakob, I'll try that now :) But there's sometimes a yellow round light stain on my model's roof when I turn them on :(
Perfect!!:D
Really FANTASTIC!!! Thank you so much! No Dodgy 3d modeling here :)
Sick model do you mind if I use it and animate it for non-profit use in an Arma 3 car mod?
can someone give me the .stl of this model pelaseeeeeeeeeeeeee. i love it !
How can i print this :( its soo dam good ! :O
@mosquitob13 It would need to be filled in under as the model is not connected and hollow lol
@KookieM yes thats right, can work around that. Just converting it to an .stl itself has been an impossible task for me. the Mesh is too complex.
Very good! Thanks

You're welcome. Also excited to see Affinity Photo being used in workflow.
I love this style. One quick tip though: you can double-click anywhere to re-center the camera: https://forum.sketchfab.com/t/quick-tip-double-click-to-focus-change-camera-target/3492

The brick texture is out of place imo, i would swap it with some metal plate textures. Anyway, great job with this!
@cie thanks! I tried to replicate material shown on concept art, but, yeah, i prolly should have made texture details more subtle so it wouldn't look so bricky.
Great Job!
@jtorta thank you!
Nice work. Can i use your ship in my browser game?
@Alexita Thanks. model may be a bit too heavy, but sure go ahead, just give me a credit somewhere and provide a link to my SF page please =)
@wintermute666 Thanks. I will cut into a sprite (2d game), how heavy it won't affect things. If you have got more, I'd like to look at them :-) Thank you.
@Alexita No worries xD. I don't really have any more ships atm sadly. I plan to make a bunch of space ships in the future, but i'm not really sure when, probably not any time soon.
Model is awesome! Very good work.
@majorkusanagi thank you!
@wintermute666 Can you work on an order? I'm interested in other ships from the series Expansion. Such as Stealth ship, Razor back, Knight shuttle :) If you are interested we can discuss prices))
@majorkusanagi As a matter of fact i am! There's a serous lack of concept art but i'm pretty sure at least Cant, The Knight, Scipio Africanus and Donnie can be done. Contact me via e-mail, let's talk. inf.tonic at gmail.com
I am trying to make a fan film for the expanse with blender, but sadly blender does not support gltf file formats. So, could you please send me this masterpiece as a .dae file to me please?
my email is spacedoge2320@gmail.com.
@spacedoge2320 catch!
Absolute stunning model, Love the Detail of the Bricks as depicted in the show. Did you build it all in Blender?
@Soldiermelly Thank you! Yep, model was made entirely in Blender, brick material was created with Substance Designer and textured in Painter.
Incredibly beautiful. I'm amazed that you took the time to model and texture even the inside of the PCD housings. Excellent work.
@CaptainTologist Thank you!
null
Amazing work! Have you thought about doing the Razorback as well?
@rasmushoegberg Thank you! Yea i was thinking about makeing more ships from the show in the future but not anytime soon sadly. Got my hands full with other projects atm.
Would it be possible the get the .dae master file as well, trying to render using other software, but having to manually create the materials is meh. If it looks like above in blender i would be really happy! If you're wondering I'm just creating a background or two for myself :P

mail: rasmushoegberg@gmail.com
@rasmushoegberg 

Yes, razorback please!!

Awesome model BTW
@wollinger Thanks! But...You can’t take the razor back. She is gone and gone and gone. He-he. Well prolly sometime this century I'll make both Anubis and Razorback...and Morrigan. xD

Hey, think your work looks great, however i do have a question. What program are you using and how do you get it to toggle around the model without rendering. I have been using Maya and Z Brush but am not familiar with other #D Modelling programs out there.

Funny how you managed all those alphas with a bit of transparency, like at the root of the grass. Works pretty well actually. The 2D butterfly looks great (that's not ironic at all).

Hi! I'm a beginner modeler and was wondering what the reason was behind why the snail logo and the F-217 are separate meshes that just sort of float above the tank? Why not just make it part of the tank texture?
This is superb!
Looks similar to Metal slug

very fun!
Awesome. Thank you very much for ability to see your UV
metal slug vibes!
Wow.

Thanks Peter ^^
daaamn... love ur skills
how you do the opacity?
@Doctor_Fastoss87 

You mean on sketchfab, or in substance painter?
@toomanydemons SkechFab
@toomanydemons see that, red glass don't work with opacity. When i try do it all model is being transparent
 https://sketchfab.com/models/039d939c7cb14a9990b1148a6cbfdfa6
@Doctor_Fastoss87 

Use the alpha from your basecolor. Put the basecolor texture in the opacity slot. In this case I think I used additive, but do some experimenting ^^. I hope this helps!
Also, don't merge objects that are transparent with objects that arent
@toomanydemons 
not work(((
https://sketchfab.com/models/039d939c7cb14a9990b1148a6cbfdfa6
@Doctor_Fastoss87 

Don't merge objects that are transparent with objects that aren't. They must be separate objects. other than that, it should work. I use it all the time. There may be a tutorial on sketchfab on how to set it up.
There is: https://blog.sketchfab.com/real-time-transparency-make-fast-beautiful/
@bartv 

Thank you!
@toomanydemons 
i try to do this, but.. i can't do opacity in the one mesh? this is a game model. And sorry for my bad English
@Doctor_Fastoss87 

Perhaps I can walk you through it personally. I'd be happy to help you out. Email me at pawnswizard@gmail.com if you'd like to connect through skype.
Hello there,

What name do I credit you under if I use this in commercial work? toomanydemons - Sketchfab?
@delange2212  That will do just fine ^^ though I don't personally care whether you do or not, the attribution license is the lowest I can go on sketchfab. Still, If I discover someone using my models and they forgot, I wouldn't care lolol. I'd just be awesome that they made something cool.

Cheers! ^^
@toomanydemons Thanks, you're a champion. Your work is inspiring

@senorimhotep Thank you for your words, I hope you will be able to get it..
Cool!
Look's awesome! Well done!
@jordanamaguire @Sergiu Thank you both, glad you like it !! I'll try to keep post model of this quality or better :D !!
Très beau travail, j'aime beaucoup ce style, félicitations!
@PHIO Merci beaucoup !! On va continuer les efforts :D
Great geometric representation and texturing!
@Zachariadis_co Thanks you !! still need to optimize the number of pictures, my 16gb ram is often a real limitation.
Very nice project, well done! Can you explain a bit whole procedure (capturing 3d shape, adjusting geometry, combining bits together etc). Thank you.
@izotop , Thank you for your words, About the project this is a small part of the whole picture, The main trouble is to wait for the good day to shot with a nice overcasted day.  I still have trouble with pictures with light too different and I thing a lot of reshooting will be necessary or I might have to make more chunks than I thought at first.  I will also try to make the final scene with the good scale, seeing it in VR is one of the purpose... I alrady took several measuring  of the place. It will be pretty accurate I think.  Right now I'm really limited with my 16gb of ram and my computer which will get upgrade soon..  I need to get more skill in mesh recontruction too.. the more I advance in it the more I see the skills I lack..
Great scan .. well done !!

I know what you mean about hardware limitations, I have exactly the same issue with 16GB of RAM .. am wanting to upgrade to 64GB .. but need to rob a bank first ;-)

I am surprised it has not been staff picked ..... :-)
@paul3uk Thank you for your words !! yes 64GB look like the sweet spot.. :D with the price of mb and cpu being more affordable, waiting for a good deal with the ram is the main issue.
cool models! :-) if you have acces to a higher mpx camera you avoid the texture to pixelate. Also if you are working with big enviroments Capture Reality is awesome for process big amount of data if you have a high powered cuda graphic card :-)
Superbe boulot !
Awesome profile ;-)
Simply amazing.... Thank's for sharing.
Thanks for sharing.
is there any video tutorials about creating this hot spots like number 1 you created
in unreal engine
Awsome work!

Hello. I am an IT student who has a project for her studies. We are writing a renderer and I was given a task to render a cathedral. Could I by any way acquire your model for this purpose? I would be really glad, because I can't find a free model (and I cannot spend 100$ just for a project), and my profesor did not give us any. Thanks in advance.  By the way your model is outstanding :)
Gorgeous stained windows!!!
What a great job! You posted it as a free one, incredible!

@alban thanks! testing for lighter meshes :-)
Fantástico, Miguel!
@iliedom gracias! :-)
Fantastic!
How do you decimate it? 
one of my problems after photogrammetry is how to decimate a high poly mesh with different resolutions in different places. for example you low resolution in the wall and higher resolution in the wheels. 
or maybe this is the direct output of  Reality Capture?
@3dSaaz Thanks! This model is decimated using small steps instead of big ones (maybe 20 decimations, not sure, testing) so the areas that dont need so many polygons like the wall have lower density and other areas have higher. Also non agressive decimation gives better curves. 
Outside CR you can use Zbrush split the model , decimate parts as you like, merge again and import the mesh again in CR for texturing. Longer to make but better quality results.
@miguelbandera Thanks a lot.

Trying to study the wireframe of your low-poly pelvis/leg-areas, that's the one part of low-poly modeling/rigging I haven't gotten down yet. Either the legs crunch super hard or the booty stretches too far.
If the Pokemon Go leaders' outlines and Link's tunic didn't stop me, your underskirt censorship isn't going to either.

@alekba lol thanks ^^
How many maps ? 4096 or 2048 ?
@Warsoul  this is a display model for sketfab, so I went with 6 2k materials. The render on artstation uses 4k materials. If this were for a game I'd def cut it down quite a bit (and probably the vertex counts as well).
Which substances you use ? They are awesome !
This one will be a staff pick !
Really nice!
@Warsoul this guy uses quite a few substances (and quite a few custom ones especially for this project -- the gun metal is a smart material I made called Twizted Metal Black lol).
@jorditorres  thanks ^^
Finally... it gets my staff pick, well deserved!
@jorditorres Awesome, thank you jorditorres! ^^

@cedric Thank you trigrou, I appreciate that :-)
Hold's up really well in VR.  Metal looks very convincing.

@stuartnorton Thanks ^^
@krawlinson That's good to know lol. Sounds awesome ^^ I have yet to try out the VR hardware.
wow!! simply stunning model man! If you fancy, I´d love to rig it up and give it a go to some cool animation...it deserves to be animated.
Cheers.
@milioserrano  

That would be fun to see ^_^ I've already rigged this guy and did some animation, but I felt it was too intensive for sketchfab on lower-end computers, mainly because I wasn't so concerned about even topology distribution. He's just supposed to look good, posed in a picture... But I may be wrong about that.

If you or anyone else would like to play with this guy in personal projects, I've set up a dropbox:

Great job on modeling such a legendary car! Think I heard they are talking to make a new model soon?

@bartv thanks and great idea!
@oliver_cerny thank you!
You're now at 5,000 followers ? Time for that milestone model? :)

@bartv Crazy times!  Wow.  Yup on it, I actually ran a twitter post the other day asking for ideas for that 5K model!
This is just perfect. I realized that it might be ambitious, but I was interested in attempting something like this for my final project for Intro to Maya in school. I am realizing after looking at this that I'm really not even close. Mainly because the best that I can do right now is attempt to model everything in Poly's. I can see that that is probably not going to work in this instance. Do you have any videos online that might help me glean a little bit of information about your workflow? I am looking to improve. Anyway, great work, this is beautiful.
@alexandermhinton wow thank you for some a nice comment. Brilliant to hear aspiring students talk so passionately about 3D modelling. (I teach 3D modelling and game development in London).  This model is far from perfect but I'm happy with how it turned out, I prefer my upgrades Parzival version actually haha!

I do have a YouTube channel but I've not really created any tutorials as yet.  I'm happy to give you some advice and feedback on work however if you want to pop me an email.  James@jculley3d.co.uk

This is so awesome.
@R0m1R Could you share your process ? How did you do it ?
@tribble42 sure, 5K screenshots (around 160 shots) and cheat engine to pause the game and have geralt steady ! (http://www.deadendthrills.com/forum/discussion/408/guide-the-witcher-3/p1) ! then I processed screenshots in agisoft photoscan ;)
Nice trick :). Great scan (and game(s)) !
awesome
Amazing!
I would like to 3D Print (full color) this model for you, for free?
Dave
Wow nice work! Do you know if it is still possible to pause the game and move the camera around after the latest patches? Also have seen the latest announcements from nVidia about 1080 graphics cards and a new app called Ansel? Sounds really good for this kind of work. Ansel is supposed to be backward compatible with quite a few cards too. Check it out :-)
Cheers San
Hey, I added the category Gaming, and I removed the categories Characters & Creatures and  Cultural Heritage & History. I think this is more appropriate for your model.
Hello!  How Can I buy or free download this model? I want to 3D print.

very nice character!

This is such a cool character, did you design it yourself? The little details on the hands(robotic claws? not sure what to call them) really sold me. Also the shape of the belt buckle connector? Fantastic.
@discoreptile It is my own original design yes. Super glad to hear you like it! It means a lot to me :)

super cool! funny to run accidentaly with Scott R work in sketchfab ??
Sick dude!
Love it, I also see a goldfish in the design though haha.

Seems your Artstation link comes up as an error 404: shame, as I am a first year in uni it would be super helpful to see thew wireframe for this! :)
@StarlingsFlight oh damn, you are right the link is now fixed. Thanks for the heads up.

Thanks for the comments, I like fish shaped vehicles :D.

If you go to the inspector, on your Sketchfab viewer you can see the wife frame and all the textures etc. Have fun. I have actually improved the mesh a bit since this version, I must upload it to here really.
@scottrobinson 
No worries :) can confirm it works on my end at least.

Haha I like the little person in there. I’ve been wondering where one operates it from though, or do they see out via camera/screens?

Gosh, thanks, I feel silly for not seeing that. To be fair I found this about ten minutes after using the site for the first time: the viewer is very useful~
@StarlingsFlight The the viewer is really awesome but it means you can't hide any mistakes anymore :D
Wow, you've reached 1000 followers, congratulations! Perhaps you could do something fun for them, like creating a milestone model ?

@emanueldemetrescu Hello,

All the files should be included inside the ELEPHANT RAW FILES archive.rar Did you try to download this archive? There are multiple versions of the elephant, one with all separate meshes in one fbx and some other split pieces. Also, the sketchfab version that is available through the viewer should be downloadable as well..

Please make sure to double check.

Hey, I removed the category People.

This is part of our category refresh, you can read about the update here:

https://blog.sketchfab.com/introducing-our-new-categories/

And view guidelines for each category here:

https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765883-Category-Guidelines

Soon we will also limit each existing Sketchfab scene to one category, so pick your category carefully.

Hi. Can you make T-pose and single mesh, weapons at other meshes?
)))
Amazing, look like shepard.
Cool work! It deserves a staffpick :)
Nice model and texture work, but the pose... Am I the only one who see that the eye and gun sight are not on one line? and she looks stupid
@tau34rus I came to recommend to align the gun to the eye-sight line :-) But the model is good, it is just the settings.

If Rojas wants to make a really cool head position, (s)he may take a look on martial arts/fencing movies/competitions, e.g. aikido stuff. The fighters have to react instantly there, and their heads are in more relaxed position - they would tilt it forward, but not to the side.

Anyway, it is IMHO and the model makes us speak :-)))
Grats!
Fantastic!!
Can i use ths model for commercial use? I will use it for projectil ads. Thanks! I really love this model ??
null
Thank you!
I really love the model, but I would like to pose it myself. Could you upload a version in the T-Pose if you have it? Thanks.
@tau34rus  don't insult!
would i be able to get a download for this model please
Where can I download this from?

Hi Pipann, this is a great model. I would love to 3d print this model for my little brother for Christmas. Is there anyway i can buy a copy of the model from you?

Hi Pipann, I was wondering why you can't make them downloadable here or at least in a different file format. I have a 3D printer and wish to print your Sans and Gaster Blaster Skull. The one on SFM aren't compatible with 3D printing programs. Could you at least send them to me through email or something? Thanks.

You make it look so easy. Love it, totally captures the feel.

Your work is great!
Thanks for sharing :)
cannot wait to try this out many thanks this is real tuff
Absolutely beautiful job mate! Saves me running around the game and trying to get screen shots of the angles I need (also, ones in the game are completely smashed). This should help me building a tot-rod for my son! Thank you very much!

Do you mind if I have these cars restored for use? It's for a project of mine - all non-profit.
Dude you should post this up on Gary's mod I think it would be a great edition to the other mods you've put up there!

@james thanks a lot, James.
Just curious, looks like the final upload was a Collada from Blender - What/How/Why?
@james for some reason when I was trying to upload as .obj it would come in as one object. So I used blender to assign different materials to different parts and exported as collada. That fixed the problem
@jamajurabaev medium export munges everything together as one object but if you export with uvs it keeps the surfaces separate so you could save the blender step ;)
@P3nT4gR4m  Got it!
thanks a lot for your help.
Will do it next time.

@bartv wow, well thank you ;)
Could you make this in Unity?
@dawtxiv I would not know how to do it because I have not practiced in unity :(
Very Cool model Thanks
could you make a texture file with this model?
Yes a texture file. Now that I know a little more about it, thats what I was asking for before. Any way to get us a texture file?
@dawtxiv hey if you're trying to get this model for vrchat i think we can help each other. Let me know
@PrisonPlanet yeah, ive been trying to get this model since before vrchat got big. When you upload it into Blender its perfect, but when you upload to unity you see that theres actually no textures.
@dawtxiv Bing translator:
Of course, do not use any texture... Rather it is a configuration between materials and vertex paint.
@PrisonPlanet You see, don't use texture on this model. Only painted materials and pretends shading with vertex paint. I doubt that unity will support it.
null
null
Buenisimo
@mementocity Pues gracias!, es bueno saber que le guste ;), comentarios como estos (aunque sean cortos) alientan mucho a seguir diseñando.
@ctool So i immagine that it cannot be used with unity3d?
@ctool It is possible to have a download with the only parts that are coherent to the model? So, only with the mesh, materials painting and rigging. Or could you make a texture? In this way it would be game ready.
@mihaihoria.popescu (Bing Translator spanish to english) In Unity will not look good... It was designed in blender with materials and painted vertices configured to see the best possible in blender. More in other programs will have graphical errors by not using textures as such...
@mihaihoria.popescu I did not understand your second message well, the translator does not help me =P.
@mihaihoria.popescu E modified the Gwen model now with a texture, I hope that this way it will correct the export errors to Unity.
you just have to download it again.
Does the rig include the face as well? i.e. is it possible to animate with bones Mouth, eyes, etc'?

Is the hair rigged?

Also, are the outfit part of the mesh or can be remove and modified séparetly to the body mesh?
@donbonbon Spanish to english: Google Translate
1) The head and pupils, body, hips, legs are set to animate fast ... but arms, Eyelids, mouth etc ... no …
2) Nope
3) Some are part of the Maya and others are separate. I mean imagine a human body without clothes and then paint the parts you want to see as clothes then separately design what protrudes from the suit.

I hope you have understood the translation xD!
@donbonbon Certainly it is worth mentioning that if you have armature or bone to animate only that the parts mentioned above are configured to facilitate the animation.
is it freestyle outline?

Great job making it look 2D, love to learn how you manage that look :D
this is really good, how did you get the outline and cell shaded effect on this it works really well
Great fine tuning on that textured outline, so stylish!
nice cell shading
using an alpha on that outline was a super good idea! ?

Hi,
sorry for the delay
Thank you for your reply
Can you guarantee me that I could without any problem print on an ultimaker your model?
1 / I should cut the model into several parts.
2 / Is it possible to separate the mature for example and elements to simplify printing
thank you philippe
@philippe0206 it would take some work and communication to make this possible since everything that you need to print would have to be double sided.  I would be happy to work with you after purchase and you can communicate with me via email so the asset prints to your liking.  Also are you wanting to print the exterior only as this would likely be easier. If you contact me via my listed email I would be happy to discuss and can give you a quote for the extra work that would need to be undertaken.
@leonlabyk done
Great! Perhaps you have the closed sails?
@Luigi.Ermini thanks but sadly I only have them down!

Although not exactly a sphere, I just reshaped the yolk into something less elongated than before: this indeed looks way more natural !

Love it!
That is so good! Love everything about it; from the air of mystery to the fireflies and reflections in the water!
Great job!
nice texture and shader work!
Iove the way you animated the fireflies glowy thingies!

One thing though, the rope being used to tie the boat, texture could use a little more work.
Cheers!
I love the water

@chrisberno

while i dissagree with your assumption of technology and science, beeing the main driver for problemsolving, the addition of 3 dimensinal space for data representation does have alot of benefits if done right and with a goal in mind. It sometimes can also create a problem of oversaturation, where you visualise the data and map it to 3d spaces but instead of that beeing a helpful tool it actually hinders the understanding of the data. But this is not the case here. @Loïc Norgeot Great Job man, really like the vibrant colors for the trees. Only downside i see is that certain (probably non Public Areas) are missing the data for example the Palace Garden in the Center of the City.
Another awesome data visualisation, staff picked!
We featured your model on Instagram!

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt6xz0bAzR5/
I think it’s  absolutely awesome
@bartv Thank you for the comment and staff pick Bart, I'm glad you enjoyed this funky view of Paris !
@kotankuro Absolutely thank you then :D
@chrisberno I indeed love seeing such data into original shapes and forms, and am indeed a tenant that cool usage of 3D can be made for the exploration of scientific stuff... And personnally, on the contrary of you @swissch, I actually think that this precise model is not especially meaningful concerning the data: and somewhat too saturated (I would indeed have loved to access the data in parks). 
If I make myself the devil's advocate: what's the point of displaying the street lights, when a simple plane map could have been enough to visually locate the trees. Also, why using the topography, when 2D could have been enough too ?  
I'm still really proud of the aesthetics of this model though ;)
@norgeotloic 

Bravo c'est vraiment magique !!!
@norgeotloic 
yes exactly but i think thats because esthetics and beauty helps also to get peoples attention and help having fun uncover data. :)
Canon !
@Alain_Badie Merci beaucoup Alain, content de voir que tu te mettes à Sketchfab ;) !
@knockz Merci :D
Beautiful point mapping, what kind of software do you use to generate this kind of map with the data?
C'est magnifique ! par curiosité, comment obtiens-tu toutes ces données ?
Super idée, cette localisation

Excellent work. What did you use to model the scene?
Pretty cool

@bartv Thanks! :)
Niiiiiice! The baked floor is a nice touch.
Tip for the hand-baking errors: It's due to overlapping UVs. You can solve this by selecting the faces & moving them on the UV map or alternatively make a new Smart UV Unwrap with a lower Angle Limit ;)
@jkaspar Thanks for the tip :) Sadly i'm not sure i'll have the time to mess with overlaps for the next ones...
But that's really good to know for further projects!
Well done. It gets my staff pick

Nicely done! Love the lighting.

beautiful!
Excellent work!! very endearing even with his many horns
This is so cool! It looks like real clay.
Is it bad that it reminds me of a Wuzzle? I hope not, cause I love it. Great creation!
you should make a The Adventures of Lil Cthulhu 3D with this, is lovely.
Awesome work! I would love to know how do you make that light baking, it's impressive!

This is so precious, it's adorable. How did you get the grainy after effects? it looks great
Your best sculpt so far. This alpha (as I guess it's an alpha ?) you use at the end to display thumbprints and the Vray baked lighting (as I guess it's VRay ?) is just excellent. In one mesh you found a real style ! :) Very good looking. And never seen before. Great job mate. Keep on !
@lashayyak Thanks, the grain comes from the sketchfab post-process effects :)
@hansolocambo Thank you! Actually i used Cycles in Blender for the texture baking!

@girvii888 I'm sorry but i really can't ^^
@hitsusandesign if you put the embedded fbx file in multiple folders and put it in the zip file and upload load it. it will be downloadable with those fbx files. but it will also put a fbx file from this website in the source folder. and it will put textures in the texture folder. but from what i can tell. as long as those fbx files with the fbx files embedded into them are in those other folders. its still downloadable. or even easier you could upload it to media fire mega.nz or something
@hitsusandesign by the way i love your work its amazing.
@girvii888 sorry man, it's not that I can't because I don't know how. I can't because the original model is DE's property and can't redistribute it.
@hitsusandesign oh i thought you made it
i found out i dont need the models textures embedded i was doing somthing wrong. now i just need the thing rigged and weight painted properly and i cant seem to get that done.
@girvii888 I've made the alternative skin on the body and the helmet from scratch but the original character is Digital Extremes property so i can't release it ^^ also i don't have the rig, i'm sorry!

How is the style of modelling can be called? like '2d style modelling' ? where I can find more info about this style?
@gabito950 Just duplicate the object, scale the duplicate up just a little, inverse the normals and give it a single material. On Sketchfab editor,inside material tab, set it to single sided rendering. I did just that with my last modelupload, if you wanna check https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/witchchan-frenemies-7cec88f0e5f144829f49aced0c5efc2c

Very very impressive, it gets my staff pick!

By the way, did you know that you can change the lights in real time with ALT+Left mouse drag? It works great with this scene.
Wow!
So cool, this is a good example why we need.to preserv our history monuments. Thanks to share this job! amazing

Wordefull work. Congratulations.
Thanks all of you. I was also thrilled when the mesh was produced. The untextured mesh looks really better than textured one. 

Thanks @bartv for staff picking, I don't know using Alt-mouse to change lighting !
Amazing scan!!
Incredible capture!
OH MY GOD!!
Very nice!  :)  with what you have scanned?
@smackshot : I scan from photos taken with my camera, a Sony A6000 and two prime lens: Sigma 60mm and Sigma 19mm
Absolutely awesome!
HoangHiepVu, You're a genius photogrammetry! Titanic work! You are a crazy perfectionist.)) I'd love to see a screenshot of the arrangement of the cells in Acute3D. 

P. S. I'll be waiting impatiently for Your new masterpieces. :)
Sorry, typo.)). I'd like to see a screenshot of the location of the cameras in Acute3D.
@lapin : I took photos in a circle around the monument: http://s28.postimg.org/ho2qfv799/screenshot_acute3d_camera.png
Yes, if possible to you share the arrangement of cameras in acute3d to have idea of manual angular work u did to us learn will be nice! (I use autodesk memento)
@magadan : for each position, I took 5 or 6 photos to cover the whole scene (with the lens 60mm, it is quite narrow), then I walked several steps and repeat it again and again. In fact, I took nearly 1000 photos, but I used 500 photos for that model, 1000 photos for it is overkill. In fact, if I can cover the whole scene with one photo, I need 60 photos around it. One reason I took a lot photos is I can remove bad photos (wrong focus, blur, etc) before the reconstruction.

Nice , but sometimes is see a weird shape of the schadow on the walls is it only by me ?
This is very neat.

But feels more like a tiny city growing at the side smooth round beach rocks. No hint of erosion and shape more typical of desert rocky formations.

Found dozens of users posting this exact model (with a couple mesh/texture issues) on clara.io. Originally, I used one of them for a No Man's Sky mod. After the recent game update, I've been forced to re-export the Millennium Falcon, but no longer had the blender source I exported from. So luckily I found this one. Not only was it a better model, it was easier to work with too. Thank you :D

@ogrebattle Et je suis même pas payé pour du placement de produit...
How did you rebuid these bottles? Create 3D models or 3d scanning?
@bruceche
I created new 3D models by starting with the 3DS Max's lathe modifier on simple splines, most of the time.

For the most part, since I used free HD models for reference, I re-used the labels from the original maps. I kind of baked them.

For the Crema di Limoncino, I had the bottle I my kitchen, so, I used high temperature to peel off the labels, stick them on white cardboard, and scan them with my multifunction printer.

Finally, for the Sortilège bottle. I recreated the labels with Photoshop inspired by various photos found on the internet and a SVG pattern used on the drink's official website..

Furthermore, for the materials, I just tryed to be relevant but without too much transparence because that was designed to real-time.

No 3D Scanning at all.
Thanks! Bless you
@YannickDeharo Sorry for the later replying! I just want to say: you are a master!
@francescotavaxd You're very welcome !

@bruceche Thank you ! have good day :)
Hello! Nice Work! Is it possible to have one 3d file per bottle ? (Im pretty beginner with 3d design :p)
Nice Work :-)
Hello @jimgrtv !

Thank you for your comment. Because you are a pretty beginner, I don't think it would really help you if I did it for you. However, don't hesitate to download the maps I hosted on Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1te52NmU0D0vV2xpYFVioq7i1VA9LduS2.

Cheers !
Hi @YannickDeharo ! 

Great work! I would love to use this for a demo app which we're trying to launch. Could we work out something so we can use these models?
Hi @youprat, I'll appreciate to see the result for satisfy my curiosity, but you are totally free to use it !
@YannickDeharo Thank you! 

Also, the transparency of the models seems off (than what is displayed here) when I create materials in Unity with the texture maps. Any suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong?
@youprat I am not an expert on Unity but I think that it depends on the material. In Sketchfab it's not really a simple transparent setup, but a system who fakes refraction (Predator effect ^^); maybe you have to manage the opacity from scratch, in Unity, by the help of my maps to obtain a standard efficient opacity setup.

But please notice of the major part of the bottles isn't transparent at all : When the liquid is colorful, it is opaque also. Maybe it is the problem you talk about ? It's not really an issue, but an optimization decision.
At first, I didn't want to make any crystal-clear bottle. I just wanted to fake opacity with some reflects as on the other bottles. That is the new Sketchfab's option, allowing fake refraction, which convinced me to present some transparent ones.
=> https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/202602073-Transparency-Opacity?utm_source=forum&utm_campaign=forum_content#refraction
@YannickDeharo I'm a noob! :D Will try figuring things out though. Have a lot to learn. Appreciate the help.
Good luck for the rest ! And show me the result if/when you can ^^ ! :)
@YannickDeharo Sure! :) Thanks
this is awesome.
Thank you so much @RustyVR !

@fetchskabhuh Shame if this is true, this was modelled by using mizo version (planes of the head Asaro cast) as a reference. 
I did measurements by eye so that must be why it is not good. My deepest apologies...

I love this! So vibrant :>
love the style and colour pallette you've used, noodle. You've even got little sacks in the tower, nice, great bit of detailing :)
Love the scene and the fact that you put up all the separate pieces, love scenes that use a small number of objects like this without it looking repetitive.
Wow, love the colours! The pine trees are so cute, they look like miniature paper cut outs! great job on the foliage stuff :)
best of luck with the contest!
loved looking at all the details!
@bart - Thanks! Definitely one of my favourite pieces from the set :)

@jenast - Yay - thank you :)

@pixeldad - I honestly wasn't sure if anybody would notice those but figured, why not, haha

@felixhindemo Yeah, I love these kinds of modular kits. Had a lot of fun laying out the scene once the pieces were made!

@curlscurly - Thank you! I was tempted to push the paper-y feel a bit more, actually - maybe I should try that with another scene :)

@chaitanyak - Glad you liked it, and thanks for the luck. Looking at all of the incredible entries, I'm gonna need it :)
realy nice scene!
Love this, great work! :)
I really like this!
Looks great!
It was very good.
@saffieraportillo @Efarys @paulopina Thanks so much :)

Awesome work! :D
Awesome!
Whoa man this is a fantastic set! I may use this in a unity demo for highschool students I have coming up if you don't mind. What sort of attribution do you want? I'd be happy to credit you and send you the scene when I finish it.
@mythsnlore Thanks so much! I absolutely don't mind - just a link to my Sketchfab account would be great. And drop me a note if you use it - I'd love to see it :)

Andrei, I downloaded your point cloud and tested it with Pointfuse to see how it converted the vegetation on the roof, the results were good.  https://skfb.ly/VODs
Hi , I saw this on the news feed, where can i adjust the size of the points?
I knew i had seen this somewhere lol
Hi there - do you know how to import a point cloud file (ply) to unity? I was able to do it other ways but the texture/color info always gets lost. 

Are you able to adjust the point size in Unity?

Wow Tom, this is so cool, what a fantastic result! Amazing job squeezing all the original models down into a single 500k one with this level of detail preserved. If you don´t mind we would love to add this model to our existing collection with the original models? It would make for a great addition and give a better view and understanding on how the floor is laid out.
I love it.
That's an impressive result Tom! Adding it to our staff picks.

Hi Thomas. 

First off really enjoyed your seminars on Monday at the Engine Shed DigiFest gave me lots to think about. Bit of a stupid question but how did you manage to get sides of the individual rooms go transparent so you can view the inside of the room from outside. I've seen it done on a lot of models particularly on archaeological trenches. Can you do it on SketchFab or is it something you have to do in other software like meshlab or blender. 

I'd also say this model is brilliant but your use of the historic map is genius. I think it would be an amazing way of bringing proper scaling into a model but also would be a great way of adding to historic building recording techniques that we use out in the field. I might try to convince my boss to allow us to try it when we get our next building survey.

Cheers
Liam
@liammck1745 Thanks for the comment Liam!

To get the walls see-through on one side you simply switch a material to 'single sided' under Faces Rendering, right at the bottom of the Materials Tab in 3D Settings.

Glad you like the combination with the floor plan. As I was making this scene I found it interesting to notice how some dimensions and ratios differed from the paper plan to the digital scans....
OMG this is amazing work.  Is there any way to upload it in obj. format. My compositing software wont work with Blend or .gITF formats.
@Scaldyboy - hey, you can open the model in Blender (it's free) and export to .OBJ
Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the billiard room ?

WOW, that's great.

Does anybody use blender to port the FBX Files to MMD?
This is the best 3D models of them ever for twins
pretty good art!
Here's my problem. I need help exporting you fbx models of Starfire and Blackfire to MMD. I got blender, and I exported the model to a pmx or pmd file, and then an error happened. What shall I do to fix it?
I dunno what program I need to port the FBX files of these models to mmd.
WOW! I love this model. You have done a wonderful job.
Great model, or rather models. An Starfire is my favorite titan. ? I want if I can put it in my Oculus home together with my other favorite hero like Kim Possible.

The color is amazing .I am a chinese boy ,I will study for it.
WOW this IS amazing
Hi, this is an awesome model with cool animations! The rib cage, the crown, the hair and the cape are duplicated meshes, but they also render texture to both sides. Can I ask what was the reason behind this solution? Is it some game engine dependent stuff? Or they shouldn't render the texture on the both side of the faces and it's just a Sketchfab thing?
Thank you so much everyone! 
@phiphi72 yes that was a game engine thing. Just didn't adjust the model for Sketchfab.
Damn, very nice!
Nice model! I love the handpainted textures.
I just have a few questions: what is the resolution of the texture if we buy the model? And is your rig a human IK rig or hand made rig ? Thanks a lot for the answers! :)
@leahotton Hi Lea. The texture resolution is 2048x2048 and the rig is a standard Maya HumanIK rig. Although the cloak and sword are custom additions.
this's awesome ! since when do you practise 3D modeling ?

This is outstanding nice work friend :)
@matt.k Thanks :)
awesome thanks!!
Love it, reminds me on steampunk style!
Brilliant! Has made my day, really nice model. Thanks
Hey there, did change a bit of the Geo and gave him a new uv and a little super suit :) 
https://sketchfab.com/models/b37a19988d5b406298a90ff117ddfe66

Really great work there.
Thanks a lot  men!, I am about to make a sculpture of him and I was searching for references and Wow, its here for download.
Very good model. 
I download it and now I'm separating each part for rigging it. If I will have success I notice you ; ) 

Thx for your sharing !
Very nice work. 
I have downloaded it and spent the last couple of nights cleaning it up. fixed a few issues with the uv maps and some of the geometry was a little bit twisted. So i straightened that out. Ran it through Substance painter as well, to give it some new metal textures. Now i have it back in the 3d editor, ready to animate with. Once i have a little animation sequence done, i will export it to my Oculus Home.

YES FOLKS! The Oculus Rift home room can have custom animated objects.. You can make anything you like for your home now!

Please could you make a blender download link i cant edit it
@nobbyt76 Could you share the download link i would like it for Vrchat
null
please fix the model
@thebattleminecraftguy 
I can't share the link on something that isn't mine...

If you go to MY collections page, you will find my reworked version of Iron Giant that is animated and ready for Oculus home. It also has a download link..
By far, from many Iron Giant fan art asset, this one is the cleanest one! And thanks for few others that improved the materials...

I made Augmented Reality / AR version animated:

details on hair are little bit complicated?and it`ll be better if color can be more pure on top of hair.
Nice work!

@chingyzhang I think this was made as part of an illustration, so the hair colour/style fits the purpose
I love all the movement in this piece! it makes it really look like part of a story unfolding in front of us! Great work!
Thank you for all the great feedback :-) the whole thing was in fact made as a part of an illustration that is both animated and composited to come alive. If you want to see it take a look: http://vimeo.com/89186927
The animation is great!
Beautiful art but the color scheme is a bit hard on the eyes O_*
this is awesome and the video-concept, wow!!! Amazing job
I love this concept, models and textures!! would you share the uv maps and textures? this looks so beautiful!!
Thank you! You can go and see the textures on my website :-) http://emiliestabell.com

Just click the project that's called Guam Bay - Chamorra Village. You'll know which one when you see it
Wow you have a very nice portfolio! Great work!
There is something i don't understand. You have two different textures for 2 models, but I'm not sure if you can upload more than one model at a time here in sketchfab, so how did you do to display the model here?
BTW you should definetively upload the fungi forest.. it is just so cool!!
+1 for the fungi forest :) Great work and great portfolio
Thank you guys! :-)

Will upload the forest for sure ;)

The way I got two models in the scene was simply by collecting them in the same Maya file and exporting them both as a single obj
Thank you for your answer! :)
You got featured on It's Art Magazine!

this looks like a creation for dreamworks school of dragons, but i'd like to fix it and use it for animations please let me download this model
Could I download this model please?

Hello Mate I have a youtube channel www.youtube.com/c/9afilms & would love to use this awesome model if you can share this with me my email is 99nihararora@gmail.com
How much to buy this?
Hey so I've decided to just make this model free to download. If you do use it for something please just add credit and send me a link so I can see how you used it.
@Kernee thanks tried using the high poly one i boughtfor 25 bucks but removing the balloon wrecked the uv map. Im trying to make a deathmatch map with it but found tons of issues rigging it for unreal 4 in my vgd class
@CleetSr388 
No problem. I can't promise this mesh will deform great when animated as that wasn't so much my intent when modeling this at such a low poly count..
Thanks Alot
@Kernee Yeah I'm havinga ton of fun trying to auto rig this but seems I'm gonna have to build its joint system peice by peice
Ok this took my alot I had to cut some of the mesh to rig it correctly, Readjust the paint weights it auto did and apply a run animation.
Hopefully Unreal 4 will be happy with this.
Thanks again I'll be sure to give you credit in the game.
https://youtu.be/AzvR6avyUb0
ok this was the most I had done with it if I have more time to work on it in the future I'll post again
https://youtu.be/7LsQIP2gHK0
I did a test animation with this model here^
https://youtu.be/N0xnpFychQM
Thanks Kernee!!
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3186631
just curious, do you have a high res model available for download also?
very creepy! Very good model thank's to share
i can't get this to work for vrchat and it's really frustrating...
Great spooky model, thanks for the share, much appreciated.
Model is incompatible with ue4. Plz fix because I can use this for many different game concepts.
Used this model in a fanmade Mortal Kombat DLC video: https://youtu.be/lcdKkpFrYE0

You could go a little more out there on his chin. It's his most defining feature! Those chin muscles(?) should be part of the geometry and more pronounced.
His second most defining feature is his beady, far set eyes. You could make those more pronounced as well. 
If you're basing it off his appearance in the MCU you're really going for a balancing act between 'Making it look like the character Thanos' and 'making it look like the actor Josh Brolin.'

@joshuagarrison  thank you for your precious critique . we're glad that you pay attention toward our work . you've giving us the idea and motivation to improve our model . we hope that you will enjoy our model after the adjustment in the future which we will surely execute in this product .

Dread it, run from it...

@UndeadKennedy well , we would have plan for that in the future but since this model is still in the making process , please be patient with us .
@dangersideburns where'd you find this.
@sabega destiny still arrives . *gripping the infinity glove with a maniac grin.
@SporeAltair thank you , the infinity glove will be there that would be assure .about the helmet ... well perhaps when we found a way that would not make him look like a primate while wearing it . that's a problem which we've found out when we did his head design. we did have his helmet though . perhaps we would upload another version of him for your comparison :)
@SporeAltair and if we have spare time at hand . we would be gladly to create the infinity version of his outfit .
The best model of Thanos out there , amazing work guys !!!
@kushal.lokesh7 i'm glad that you like it . our gratitude toward you my friend :)
Really detailed and overall totally amazing, great job!
The best Thanos on the web.
How do you download fbx file?
I love the armour, amazing. The face needs to be improbed a little. Great job bro
@goart Can you please make Thanos T-Pose?
I like that you gave him TWO(2) Gauntlets. .. For some reason, not even MARVEL has done that!?! WTF
amazing!
null
@iamgoumouf Do you even know how the gauntlet looks like? where are the sockets for the stones in these gauntlets? they are just the gloves of the armor...
@vistaero @iamgoumouf They are the original gloves. If you look at a picture of the older Thanos, from older Marvel comics/pictures, he has 2 golden gloves (NOT infinity gauntlets).

I have a question: How did you do the texture? I've tried to make a model of a Vindicator star Destroyer, but I'm crap at making textures. Any advice?
A star destroyer with decent firing arcs? What?
Is there any way to turn the single turret?
this can look extremely intimidating at certain angles

is lighting baked or lights were imported into sketchfab?
The lighting was made directly on sketchfab. the red directional light project shadows, a point light is into the cabin and the environnement queenmarry chimney is on.
Wow, love the lighting. Great job!
It's a beautiful environment and especially the lighting. Congrats on this piece! Is it possible to make a small tutorial on the lighting or overall as you like? :)
Hello everyone, thank you for your feedback! If you are interested by lighting , I invite you to observe the works of the great masters and nature. Look Rembrandt , Vermeer, or  Chief Operator as Darius Khondji , Pawel Edelman, Robert Elswit , Roger Deakins ect. Look the art of Dice Tsutsumi , Victor Antonov or Nicolas Bouvier.
To illuminate properly , focus on one main light that give volume to your stage and draw attention to the important elements . A second light often diffuse, cold, and weaker helps reduce shadows . The optional back light, brighter than the main light allows to detach the characters in the background when composing an image from a given viewpoint. And most importantly , know how to remain simple. A single well-placed light has more strength than 15 who are trying desperately to build an image.
@jermepousse Thanks a lot for you info and help on lighting. Beautiful work once again :D

Amazing work. Saw this on the motionvfx mObject 2 plugin site. Thanks for sharing – will use this to experiment / test with.
This is pretty incredible!  How many photos does it take to get something like this?  Also, how do you get photos so close to the ground?  I have a problem with not being able to get the camera low enough when I'm scanning small objects, leaving some messy low poly on the underside.

Really like your project ! I'm making a game project during my freetime and I wanted to make it with a old comics style but wasn't sure about the final result in 3D and what would be the good workflow for it.

I will follow your progress for sure :)

Hi Tzeshi ,
I am a new Sketchfab user ,
Would you mind to give me any info on how to do this rendering on sketchfab with this kind of style?
i like the coloring/texturing style. Any good website for the first timer that i can go to have a look?

I am a 3ds max and vray user.

Thanks

I need you to teach me!
how do you do this?  its like a 3d sketch
Phenomenal!
Splendid! What kind of technique do you use?
Thanks everyone! :)

It's very much a 3D sketch - I use a grey or white marker brush to draw like I would in 2D, only it's 3D and it has to read from all directions.
Damn that's wonderful!
this is insane- really amazing!
Just wanted to let you know this was featured on IAMag's Real Time Selection! Congrats!
