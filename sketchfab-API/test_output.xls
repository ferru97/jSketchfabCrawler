Amazing!
This is magical, so inspiring!!! I love how clever you did this!
@mauricesvay Thanks Maurice ^^
@curlscurly Thanks a lot Curls, wanted to test a bunch of things on this one and the illustration helps a lot ^^
Huge fan of Heikala's work, and you really nailed the look. Nicely done! ^^
@tobiasroevik Me too!!! Thank you Tobias.
Gorgeous! You captured the look and feel of watercolor so well!

I also love the cheeky move pulled with putting the content inside a box! Brilliant!
@Bitzawolf Thank you ^^, like a lot mixing watercolor look and 3d
Me quieren encerrá en un manicornio!!
I love it!
@Buenas_tardes xDDD muchas gracias!!
Copón que bonico.
@pepeluilly Muchas gracias Jose Luis!!
Such a nice use of the 3D viewer! <3
Despite the limited camera motion the parallax effect works really nice.
@essimoon Don´t want to get my dirty tricks revealed hehehe, Thank you !!
This is really lovely, the illusion is so well played that even when rotating and noticing it's a very well made 3D model makes me smile. Awesome stuff juan!
@ricardoman13 Thanks for those kind words Ricardo, truly ^^
Awesome! Staff pick :)
wow! The textures and the 3d model are really well made. From every angle I can rotate from, it looks like a  polished watercolor painting.
@james Thank you so much James!!!! :DD
@jx Ohhh so glad you think that, that was my intention ^^ Thanks.
You did a good! Nice job!

OK, I'm so happy you uploaded it on Sketchfab ! It's even more fantastic to be able to move it and snoop around for the details ! Congratulations again, you did amazing ! (and special mention for the subtle idle moves, it gives life to the overall piece)
This is amazing! 
love the style and animations you added, So glad this got a staff pick!
YES! Thank's for uploading this! I love the crystals and the birds.
Fantastic! Loved following the progress of this model as well as your other work. You really got talent telling stories with your artworks!
Holy waw! I don't think I've ever actually liked a 3D model this way; I mean, not at all for the technical achievement and wholly because it's just nice to look at. I'm pretty certain this is the best 3D thing I've ever seen since digital 3D exists.
This is so good it's freaky!
WOA! Amazing work! Congrats!!!
Amazing. Just absolutely amazing! And inspiring! Now I wanna do this!
Wow!!  LUV it!  Brilliant!
Absolutely amazing.
This is now among my favourite work here on Sketchfab! I love the whole scene, and how you added a bit of idle animation too.
beautiful!
Just perfect ! Super! Great!
incredible piece. So much to observe. nice one!
Been waiting for this masterpiece to be finished! :D Just as amazing as I thought it would be!

omg that body hair, i cant belive you did such a detail ;o
Really nice model !
I noticed many textures are set with nearest filtering, may I ask why?
@stephomi To make the skin texture as sharp and as detailed as possible, the graininess also helps the illusion of having fine pores and skin hairs. It's just a little trick I use when the texture res isn't high enough. However it might be too noisy to some people.
null
Oh Goddess
awesome anatomy
Me gusta maldita sea!!!
Will it sets sharing download?
@wewecat I've repacked & reuploaded the file, you can download it now :)
Amazing!! the skin is well created, and the effect of the hair around the body, aww.. it excite me jeje..
amazing detail and realism down to the fine body hair Totally impressed!
amazing!
Really awesome work!
@stephomi , the textures are so large and @patrix I noticed that you actually modeled tiny hairs all over the skin. Isn't that too much detail?
@grillswills After I replace the original fibermesh hair with optimized hair cards, I've saved hundreds thousands of tris-count. So I decided to add some fine hairs as a test, and the total tris-count ended up even less than before :P

The fine hairs are just a quick test, so the placement, lengths and density aren't very accurate :\
@patrix Thank you very much for sharing this great model??
i noticed the fur/hair used in her body wow the result are really tremendously nice.
thank you for your great modle
Need live pose
The hair distribution is a little odd O.O
For example, you could get rid of the hair on her panties....and usually most men dont even have hair down to their feet (usually stops above the ankles), hand hair usually stops at the wrist and on your face it usually goes across you cheeks and up to the tip of the nose and above the lips and finally, you can only grow hair on around your areola not on them XD O.O
Oh well, it's just that, otherwise i love iitttt :D
@neomax This is just a test upload, its pose is not really good for rigging. I will reupload if I make anymore changes or rigged for animation.
@radiated_monkey As I've said a few comments below you, the fine hairs are just a quick test, so the placement, lengths and density aren't very accurate.
Upload the two sheets test renderings ~
https://goo.gl/photos/K3UXSZ2Y4cn8ag4HA This is a focal length of 85mm
https://goo.gl/photos/Ebbn6KaYAB8CJAos7 This is a focal length of 45mm
@wewecat I suggest you change your lighting/exposure setup, and maybe add some SSS to the hair, or change the hair reflection to anisotropic.

Here's some of my quick test render with marmoset toolbag: http://imgur.com/a/62YDH

Awesome! That's so cool. Thanks Bart :D
Can't believe my eyes :o :o :o , Best thing i've ever seen !! 
but can i ask how you rendered it to look like a 2D image ? 
thanks
@haniissa - I used the diffuse map in the emission map slot with it set to the highest value - which means the diffuse cannot be affected by shadow. I also used a middle grey colour to light the scene instead of a background image. Keep your eyes out for my making of blog post. I will explain in more detail :)
Very beautiful work. Its remind me LIMBO artstyle
@manikseth - i heart LIMBO so much... def something i try to draw inspiration from all the time!

over 1000 views! oh my gosh, i feel the love - thanks guys!
this is more than a model.. its an experience!! great work
nice work!
beautiful!!
This opens a whole new take on modeling.
thanks for the kind words everybody! I really appreciate all the positive feedback :)
Very cool artwork. The game looks promising.

About the rendering, instead of using an emissive map, switching to shadeless may also work.
Hey Maurice, thanks for the kind words! I did toy with shadeless but I like using emission as you can control a slight amount of shading, just to make the trees stand out a bit more. Yes the game looks great, I can't wait!!
love everything i've seen so far of this game
Very beautiful
Wow, looks very good.

Amazing animation work! Works like this help pushing the idea that 3D is an amazing platform for storytelling :)
Agh! why would you restrict the camera so much? 
If one cannot even move the image at all then why have it on sketchfab? Might as well be just a mp4 file.
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know you can move around by going into the model inspector mode. I love seeing these wonderful works in closer detail.
It's actually unbelievable for me how much texturing does! 
Insanely low-poly models, still looks so real! Love it!
woah this is amazing! can you... double-staff pick something? :D
If so, this scene would deserve it!

Wow, awesome fan art of Euphonium!
????:O Love the light and the wonderful mix between cell- and realtime-shading ^_^
This is probabaly the most anime-looking 3D model I've seen so far. The shading is on point

Very good job, would love to see more !
Thanks everyone! ^///^
Instrument reflections very well done.
Nice model. How did this your toon shader ?
Really great trick - no diffuse, just emission
How did you achieve this dou? : o No tutorial needed but if you could just underline your workflow steps or something I'd appreciate it.
@3rton - As far as I can tell, all the color is achieved with just emission and no diffuse, which lets the cartoon stay cartoon, even though the scene is lit, for the instrument's reflections.

Bake light per Vertex with a two tone shading ? Nice way to get a sharp light transition !
Great job !
Seems very hard to really control the light though.. is the light handpainted ?
null
Thanks everybody, I'll be doing a write-up on how I achieved this effect in a few days.
Good job doing that ! Can't wait for your explanation
Hi Poribo, which program of modeling that you used for created this character? Blender with NPR?
Really good job Poribo.
Is texture with the lighting ? Or it is a cell-shading shader ?
We recommended your work to IAMAG.CO and they featured it:

http://www.iamag.co/features/sketchfab-realtime-selection-62/

Congrats :)
For those who asked if it is a cell shading, turn on wire frame, it consists of two meshes with an outer offset of which the outer one has inverted normals, invisible backfaces and painted black, this is genius, I'm a fan.
WOOOOOO best 3D x 2D model.
fiu!!
You could create a tutorial ?

@maiminase

@texar
comment Thanks!
I want to the remodeling for the data to figure model.
ok  no proplem I can do after  modeling
how can you gen such a amazing 3d model? which software you used plz? and where can I learn this?
@satomic
thanks for your comment!
Desire to three-dimensional to 2Dcharacter is the driving force of my work.
is this for download
so amazing.. how on earth did you manage to balance the front and side looks on her anime face...
most 3D anime model usually had only good looking on the front side but very distorted when look on the left side or right side..
@k7539518246k 
Sorry, there is no plans for now.

@Ryua
When modeling the face, be careful of the jaw line and cheek swelling. I hope it will be helpful.
what a great tribute to the anime! well done man
Really nice model.

Since I couldn't private message you: 
I'm the developer of AIGE And PWLib (a Gyakuten Saiban fan case creation engine), and i'm interested in this model to use as a demonstration for the engine's 3D capabilities (though photos and video). The model won't be distributed with the engine and will only be used for demonstration purposes.

Love it! I want to check this with an Oculus.
excellent texturing and lighting! What render engine did you use? The AO is a bit strong but that could be the effect you wanted to add a surreal feel to it.  well done.
Thanks! If anyone interested,the final product can be seen here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPDrgA39PE
2shaderbytes thanks, i used vray. AO is a bit strong, but its kind of a habit for me, i add vray dirt to every shader.
@ruslans3d that looks amazing! You should add the link to the video and to the Google Play store in the model description. We support Markdown (see the editor for help) to you can create a nice layout.
Thanks, Bart! I will do it

Awesome, I thought it was the original illustratiom. Nicely done!
Awesome :) How do you obtain that cel shading effect ?
Dat Booty.
wow
Everyone , thank you for your comment.
I'm glad :)

This is not cel shading effect.
It is the polygon in the polygon  ,outside of the polygon ?Reversal
Outside of the polygon  looks like a cel shading effect:)
?Excuse me,I don't have a good command of English and can not explain in detail. ?
Wonderful *clap*
wow awesome
Dude that cell shading method is a Genius. Definitely trying that on my current project.
that is awesome 10 out of ten
